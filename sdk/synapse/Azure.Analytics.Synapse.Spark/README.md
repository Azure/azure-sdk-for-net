# Azure Synapse Spark client library for .NET

This directory contains the open source subset of the .NET SDK. For documentation of the complete Azure SDK, please see the [Microsoft Azure .NET Developer Center](http://azure.microsoft.com/develop/net/).

Use the client library for Synapse to:

- Submit Spark Batch job and Spark Session Job

Azure Synapse is a limitless analytics service that brings together enterprise data warehousing and Big Data analytics. It gives you the freedom to query data on your terms, using either serverless on-demand or provisioned resourcesâ€”at scale. Azure Synapse brings these two worlds together with a unified experience to ingest, prepare, manage, and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs. 

## Getting started

The complete Microsoft Azure SDK can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Azure Downloads Page](http://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/?sdk=net) and ships with support for building deployment packages, integrating with tooling, rich command line tooling, and more.

For the best development experience, developers should use the official Microsoft NuGet packages for libraries. NuGet packages are regularly updated with new functionality and hotfixes.

### Install the package
Install the Spark client library for Azure Synapse Analytics for .NET with [NuGet][nuget]:

```PowerShell
dotnet add package Azure.Analytics.Synapse.Spark --version 0.1.0-preview.1
```

### Prerequisites
* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
* An existing Azure Synapse workspace. If you need to create an Azure Synapse workspace, you can use the Azure Portal or [Azure CLI][azure_cli].

If you use the Azure CLI, the command looks like below:

```PowerShell
az synapse workspace create \
    --name <your-workspace-name> \
    --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> \
    --storage-account <your-storage-account-name> \
    --file-system <your-storage-file-system-name> \
    --sql-admin-login-user <your-sql-admin-user-name> \
    --sql-admin-login-password <your-sql-admin-user-password> \
    --location <your-workspace-location>
```

### Authenticate the client
In order to interact with the Azure Synapse Analytics service, you'll need to create an instance of the [SparkBatchClient][spark_batch_client_class] or [SparkSessionClient][spark_session_client_class] class. You need a **workspace endpoint**, which you may see as "Development endpoint" in the portal,
 and **client secret credentials (client id, client secret, tenant id)** to instantiate a client object.

Client secret credential authentication is being used in this getting started section but you can find more ways to authenticate with [Azure identity][azure_identity]. To use the [DefaultAzureCredential][DefaultAzureCredential] provider shown below,
or other credential providers provided with the Azure SDK, you should install the Azure.Identity package:

```PowerShell
Install-Package Azure.Identity
```

## Examples
The Microsoft.Azure.Synapse supports the CRUD of spark batch job.

### Spark Batch Job examples
* [List spark batch job](#list-spark-batch-job)
* [Create spark batch job](#create-spark-batch-job)
* [Delete spark batch job](#delete-spark-batch-job)

### List spark batch job
List the spark batch job under the specific spark pool of a specific synapse workspace

```C# Snippet:ListSparkBatchJobs
Response<SparkBatchJobCollection> jobs = batchClient.GetSparkBatchJobs();
foreach (SparkBatchJob job in jobs.Value.Sessions)
{
    Console.WriteLine(job.Name);
}
```

### Create spark batch job
Create spark batch job under specific workspace and spark pool.

```C# Snippet:CreateBatchJob
string name = $"batchSample";
string file = string.Format("abfss://{0}@{1}.dfs.core.windows.net/samples/java/wordcount/wordcount.jar", fileSystem, storageAccount);
SparkBatchJobOptions options = new SparkBatchJobOptions(name: name, file: file)
{
    ClassName = "WordCount",
    Arguments =
    {
        string.Format("abfss://{0}@{1}.dfs.core.windows.net/samples/java/wordcount/shakespeare.txt", fileSystem, storageAccount),
        string.Format("abfss://{0}@{1}.dfs.core.windows.net/samples/java/wordcount/result/", fileSystem, storageAccount),
    },
    DriverMemory = "28g",
    DriverCores = 4,
    ExecutorMemory = "28g",
    ExecutorCores = 4,
    ExecutorCount = 2
};

SparkBatchJob jobCreated = batchClient.CreateSparkBatchJob(options);
```

### Cancel spark batch job
Cancel a Spark batch job with Spark batch id under specific workspace and Spark pool.

```C# Snippet:DeleteSparkBatchJob
Response operation = batchClient.CancelSparkBatchJob(jobId);
```
