Since all environments are Internet connected, firewalls need to be installed on the boundary, i.e., between the Internet and the in-scope environment. Additionally, firewalls need to be installed between the less trusted DMZ (De-Militarized Zone) networks and internal trusted networks. DMZs are typically used to serve traffic from the Internet and therefore is a target of attack. By implementing a DMZ and using a firewall to control traffic flows, a compromise of the DMZ won\u0027t necessarily mean a compromise of the internal trusted networks and corporate/customer data. Adequate logging and alerting should be in place to help organizations quickly identify a compromise to minimize the opportunity for the threat actor to further compromise the internal trusted networks. The intent of this control is to ensure there is adequate control between trusted and less trusted networks.",

These accounts may not follow the standard password policies because expiration of service account passwords often breaks functionality. Therefore, they may be configured with weak passwords or passwords that are reused within the organization. Another potential issue, particularly within a Windows environment, may be that the operating system caches the password hash. This can be a big problem if either: the service account is configured within a directory service, since this account can be used access across multiple systems with the level of privileges configured, or the service account is local, the likelihood is that the same account / password will be used across multiple systems within the environment. The above problems can lead to a threat actor gaining access to more systems within the environment and can lead to a further elevation of privilege and/or lateral movement. The intent therefore is to ensure that service accounts are properly hardened and secured to help protect them from being taken over by a threat actor, or by limiting the risk should one of these service accounts be compromised.",

Having AV deployed to all system components that support its use, will help mitigate some of the risks of anti-malware being introduced into the environment. It only takes a single endpoint to be unprotected to potentially provide a vector of attack for a threat actor to gain a foothold into the environment. AV should therefore be used as one of several layers of defense to protect against this type of threat.",

A DMZ is deemed less trusted since there is a much great risk of hosts that are publicly accessible from being compromised by external threat actors. Public access should always terminate in these less trusted networks which are adequately segmented by the firewall to help protect internal resources and data. The intent of this control is to ensure all public access terminates within these less trusted DMZs as if resources on the trusted internal networks were public facing, a compromise of these resources provides a threat actor a foothold into the network where sensitive data is being held.",

Configuration creep can be introduced for numerous reasons, such as, temporary changes to aid troubleshooting, temporary changes for ad-hoc functional changes, to introduce quick fixes to issues which can sometimes be overly permissive due to the pressures of introducing a quick fix. As an example, you may introduce a temporary firewall rule \u0022Allow All\u0022 to overcome an urgent issue. The intent of this control is twofold, firstly to identify where there are misconfigurations which may introduce insecurities and secondly to help identify firewall rules which are no longer needed and therefore can be removed, i.e., if a service has been retired but the firewall rule has been left behind.",

These accounts may not follow the standard password policies because expiration of service account passwords often breaks functionality. Therefore, they may be configured with weak passwords or passwords that are reused within the organization. Another potential issue, particularly within a Windows environment, may be that the operating system caches the password hash. This can be a big problem if either: the service account is configured within a directory service, since this account can be used access across multiple systems with the level of privileges configured, or the service account is local, the likelihood is that the same account / password will be used across multiple systems within the environment. The above problems can lead to a threat actor gaining access to more systems within the environment and can lead to a further elevation of privilege and/or lateral movement. The intent therefore is to ensure that service accounts are properly hardened and secured to help protect them from being taken over by a threat actor, or by limiting the risk should one of these service accounts be compromised.",

With the average cost of a data breach being reported to be in the millions of dollars, it is critical that this data breach lifecycle is reduced to not only minimize the exposure window to data, but also to reduce the timeframe a threat actor has to exfiltrate data from the environment. By reducing this window, organizations can reduce the overall cost of a data breach.",

Organizations usually utilize the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) rating provided by vendors or security researchers. It is recommended that if organization rely on CVSS, that a re-ranking mechanism is included within the process to allow the organization to change the ranking based upon an internal risk assessment. Sometimes, the vulnerability may not be application due to the way the application has been deployed within the environment. For example, a Java vulnerability may be released which impacts a specific library that is not used by the organization.",

These accounts may not follow the standard password policies because expiration of service account passwords often breaks functionality. Therefore, they may be configured with weak passwords or passwords that are reused within the organization. Another potential issue, particularly within a Windows environment, may be that the operating system caches the password hash. This can be a big problem if either: the service account is configured within a directory service, since this account can be used access across multiple systems with the level of privileges configured, or the service account is local, the likelihood is that the same account / password will be used across multiple systems within the environment. The above problems can lead to a threat actor gaining access to more systems within the environment and can lead to a further elevation of privilege and/or lateral movement. The intent therefore is to ensure that service accounts are properly hardened and secured to help protect them from being taken over by a threat actor, or by limiting the risk should one of these service accounts be compromised.",

By documenting a policy and procedure of how the ISV deploys anti-malware decencies, this ensures the consistent rollout and maintenance of this technology in reducing the risk of malware to the environment.",

Having AV deployed to all system components that support its use, will help mitigate some of the risks of anti-malware being introduced into the environment. It only takes a single endpoint to be unprotected to potentially provide a vector of attack for a threat actor to gain a foothold into the environment. AV should therefore be used as one of several layers of defense to protect against this type of threat.",

It is recommended that if organization rely on CVSS, that a re-ranking mechanism is included within the process to allow the organization to change the ranking based upon an internal risk assessment. Sometimes, the vulnerability may not be application due to the way the application has been deployed within the environment. For example, a Java vulnerability may be released which impacts a specific library that is not used by the organization.",

Firewalls will typically control traffic flows based upon IP Addresses and protocols/ports, more feature rich firewalls can also provide additional \u0022application layer\u0022 defenses by inspecting application traffic to safeguard against misuse, vulnerabilities and threats based upon the applications being accessed. These protections are only as good as the configuration of the firewall, therefore strong firewall policies and support procedures need to be in place to ensure they are configured to provide adequate protection of internal assets. For example, a firewall with a rule to allow ALL traffic from ANY source to ANY destination is just acting as a router.",

Unused accounts should be disabled/removed to reduce the attack surface a threat actor has to carry out account compromise activities. These accounts may be due to a leavers process not being carried out properly, a staff member going on long term sickness or a staff member going on maternity/paternity leave. By implementing a quarterly process to identify these accounts, organizations can minimize the attack surface.",

These accounts may not follow the standard password policies because expiration of service account passwords often breaks functionality. Therefore, they may be configured with weak passwords or passwords that are reused within the organization. Another potential issue, particularly within a Windows environment, may be that the operating system caches the password hash. This can be a big problem if either: the service account is configured within a directory service, since this account can be used access across multiple systems with the level of privileges configured, or the service account is local, the likelihood is that the same account / password will be used across multiple systems within the environment. The above problems can lead to a threat actor gaining access to more systems within the environment and can lead to a further elevation of privilege and/or lateral movement. The intent therefore is to ensure that service accounts are properly hardened and secured to help protect them from being taken over by a threat actor, or by limiting the risk should one of these service accounts be compromised.",

With the average cost of a data breach being reported to be in the millions of dollars, it is critical that this data breach lifecycle is reduced to not only minimize the exposure window to data, but also to reduce the timeframe a threat actor has to exfiltrate data from the environment. By reducing this window, organizations can reduce the overall cost of a data breach.",
