# Azure Mixed Reality Authentication client library for .NET

Mixed Reality services, like Azure Spatial Anchors, Azure Remote Rendering, and others, use the Mixed Reality security
token service (STS) for authentication. This package supports exchanging Mixed Reality account credentials for an access
token from the STS that can be used to access Mixed Reality services.

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Mixed Reality Authentication client library for .NET using one of the following methods.

From Visual Studio Package Manager:

```powershell
Install-Package Azure.MixedReality.Authentication
```

From .NET CLI

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.MixedReality.Authentication
```

Add a package reference:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Azure.MixedReality.Authentication" Version="1.0.0" />
```

### Prerequisites

- You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- You must have an account with an [Azure Mixed Reality service](https://azure.microsoft.com/topic/mixed-reality/):
  - [Azure Remote Rendering](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/remote-rendering/)
  - [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/)
- Familiarity with the authentication and credential concepts from [Azure.Identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md).

### Authenticate the client

Mixed Reality services support a few different forms of authentication:

- Account Key authentication
  - Account keys enable you to get started quickly with using Mixed Reality services. But before you deploy your application
    to production, we recommend that you update your app to use Azure AD authentication.
- Azure Active Directory (AD) token authentication
  - If you're building an enterprise application and your company is using Azure AD as its identity system, you can use
    user-based Azure AD authentication in your app. You then grant access to your Mixed Reality accounts by using your
    existing Azure AD security groups. You can also grant access directly to users in your organization.
  - Otherwise, we recommend that you obtain Azure AD tokens from a web service that supports your app. We recommend this
    method for production applications because it allows you to avoid embedding the credentials for access to a Mixed
    Reality service in your client application.

See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/concepts/authentication) for detailed instructions and information.

#### Authentication examples

Below are some examples of some common authentication scenarios, but more examples and information can be found at
[Azure.Identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md).

##### Authenticating with account key authentication

Use the `MixedRealityStsClient` constructor overload accepting an `AzureKeyCredential` to configure account key
authentication with the Mixed Reality STS:

```csharp
AzureKeyCredential keyCredential = new AzureKeyCredential(accountKey);
MixedRealityStsClient client = new MixedRealityStsClient(accountId, accountDomain, keyCredential);
```

> Note: Account key authentication is **not recommended** for production applications.

##### Authenticating with an AAD client secret

```csharp
TokenCredential aadCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, new TokenCredentialOptions
{
    AuthorityHost = new Uri($"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}")
});

MixedRealityStsClient client = new MixedRealityStsClient(accountId, accountDomain, aadCredential);
```

##### Authenticating a user using device code authentication

```csharp
Task deviceCodeCallback(DeviceCodeInfo deviceCodeInfo, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    Debug.WriteLine(deviceCodeInfo.Message);
    Console.WriteLine(deviceCodeInfo.Message);
    return Task.FromResult(0);
}

TokenCredential deviceCodeCredential = new DeviceCodeCredential(deviceCodeCallback, tenantId, clientId, new TokenCredentialOptions
{
    AuthorityHost = new Uri($"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}"),
});

MixedRealityStsClient client = new MixedRealityStsClient(accountId, accountDomain, deviceCodeCredential);

AccessToken token = await client.GetTokenAsync();
```

See [here](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Device-Code-Flow) for more
information about using device code authentication flow.

##### Interactive authentication with DefaultAzureCredential

Use the `DefaultAzureCredential` object with `includeInteractiveCredentials: true` to use default interactive authentication
flow:

```csharp
TokenCredential credential = new DefaultAzureCredential(includeInteractiveCredentials: true);

MixedRealityStsClient client = new MixedRealityStsClient(accountId, accountDomain, credential);
```

## Key concepts

### MixedRealityStsClient

The `MixedRealityStsClient` is the client library used to access the Mixed Reality STS to get an access token.

Tokens obtained from the Mixed Reality STS have a lifetime of **24 hours**.

### Thread safety

We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples

### Retrieve an access token

```csharp
AzureKeyCredential keyCredential = new AzureKeyCredential(accountKey);
MixedRealityStsClient client = new MixedRealityStsClient(accountId, accountDomain, keyCredential);

AccessToken token = await client.GetTokenAsync();
```

See the authentication examples [above](#authenticate-the-client) for more complex authentication scenarios.

#### Using the access token in a Mixed Reality client library

Some Mixed Reality client libraries might accept an access token in place of a credential. For example:

```csharp
// GetMixedRealityAccessTokenFromWebService is a hypothetical method that retrieves
// a Mixed Reality access token from a web service. The web service would use the
// MixedRealityStsClient and credentials to obtain an access token to be returned
// to the client.
AccessToken accessToken = await GetMixedRealityAccessTokenFromWebService();

SpatialAnchorsAccount account = new SpatialAnchorsAccount(accountId, accountDomain);
SpatialAnchorsClient client = new SpatialAnchorsClient(account, accessToken);
```

Note: The `SpatialAnchorsClient` usage above is hypothetical and may not reflect the actual library. Consult the
documentation for the client library you're using to determine if and how this might be supported.
