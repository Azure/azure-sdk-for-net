# Microsoft Azure Elastic SAN management client library for .NET

Microsoft Azure Elastic SAN is a cloud-native service that offers a scalable, cost-effective, high-performance, and comprehensive storage solution for a range of compute options. Get the same simplified management experience in the cloud as with your on-premises storage area network (SAN). Gain higher resiliency and minimize downtime with rapid provisioning.

This library supports managing Microsoft Azure Elastic SAN resources.

This library follows the [new Azure SDK guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html), and provides many core capabilities:

    - Support MSAL.NET, Azure.Identity is out of box for supporting MSAL.NET.
    - Support [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for distributed tracing.
    - HTTP pipeline with custom policies.
    - Better error-handling.
    - Support uniform telemetry across all languages.
