# How to extract the description of a critical result inference using a synchronous call

In this sample it is shown how you can construct a request, add a configuration, create a client, send a synchronous request and use the result returned to extract the description of a critical result.

## Creating a PatientRecord with Details, Encounter, and Document Content
To create a comprehensive patient record, instantiate a `PatientRecord` object with the patient’s details, encounter information, and document content. This record includes the patient’s birth date, sex, encounter class, period, and associated clinical documents, such as radiology reports. The `PatientRecord` object is then populated with these details to ensure all relevant patient information is accurately captured and organized.
```C# Snippet:Critical_Result_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreatePatientRecord
string id = "patient_id2";
PatientDetails patientInfo = new()
{
    BirthDate = new System.DateTime(1959, 11, 11),
    Sex = PatientSex.Female,
};
PatientEncounter encounter = new("encounterid1")
{
    Class = EncounterClass.InPatient,
    Period = new TimePeriod
    {
        Start = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28),
        End = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28)
    }
};
List<PatientEncounter> encounterList = new() { encounter };
ClinicalDocumentContent documentContent = new(DocumentContentSourceType.Inline, DOC_CONTENT);
PatientDocument patientDocument = new(ClinicalDocumentContentType.Note, "doc2", documentContent)
{
    ClinicalType = ClinicalDocumentType.RadiologyReport,
    CreatedAt = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28),
    AdministrativeMetadata = CreateDocumentAdministrativeMetadata()
};
PatientRecord patientRecord = new(id);
patientRecord.Details = patientInfo;
patientRecord.Encounters.Add(encounter);
patientRecord.PatientDocuments.Add(patientDocument);
```

## Specifying Document Content for Patient Record
To define the document content for a patient record, create a constant string `DOC_CONTENT` that includes detailed clinical history, comparison, technique, findings, and impression sections. This content provides comprehensive information about the patient’s medical history, the techniques used in the examination, and the findings from the radiology report. This structured document content is essential for accurate and thorough patient records.
```C# Snippet:Critical_Result_Sync_Tests_Samples_Doc_Content
private const string DOC_CONTENT = "CLINICAL HISTORY:   "
    + "\r\n20-year-old female presenting with abdominal pain. Surgical history significant for appendectomy."
    + "\r\n "
    + "\r\nCOMPARISON:   "
    + "\r\nRight upper quadrant sonographic performed 1 day prior."
    + "\r\n "
    + "\r\nTECHNIQUE:   "
    + "\r\nTransabdominal grayscale pelvic sonography with duplex color Doppler "
    + "\r\nand spectral waveform analysis of the ovaries."
    + "\r\n "
    + "\r\nFINDINGS:   "
    + "\r\nThe uterus is unremarkable given the transabdominal technique with "
    + "\r\nendometrial echo complex within physiologic normal limits. The "
    + "\r\novaries are symmetric in size, measuring 2.5 x 1.2 x 3.0 cm and the "
    + "\r\nleft measuring 2.8 x 1.5 x 1.9 cm.\n \r\nOn duplex imaging, Doppler signal is symmetric."
    + "\r\n "
    + "\r\nIMPRESSION:   "
    + "\r\n1. Normal pelvic sonography. Findings of testicular torsion."
    + "\r\n\nA new US pelvis within the next 6 months is recommended."
    + "\n\nThese results have been discussed with Dr. Jones at 3 PM on November 5 2020.\n "
    + "\r\n";
```

## Creating Ordered Procedures for Patient Record
To add ordered procedures to a patient record, instantiate a `DocumentAdministrativeMetadata` object and create a `FhirR4Coding` object with the relevant procedure details. This includes the display name, code, and system. Then, create a `FhirR4CodeableConcept` object and add the coding to it. Finally, create an `OrderedProcedure` object with a description and code, and add it to the `OrderedProcedures` list of the `DocumentAdministrativeMetadata` object. This process ensures that the ordered procedures are accurately documented and associated with the patient record.
```C# Snippet:Critical_Result_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateDocumentAdministrativeMetadata
DocumentAdministrativeMetadata documentAdministrativeMetadata = new DocumentAdministrativeMetadata();

FhirR4Coding coding = new()
{
    Display = "US PELVIS COMPLETE",
    Code = "USPELVIS",
    System = "Http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/cpt-all"
};

FhirR4CodeableConcept codeableConcept = new();
codeableConcept.Coding.Add(coding);

OrderedProcedure orderedProcedure = new()
{
    Description = "US PELVIS COMPLETE",
    Code = codeableConcept
};

documentAdministrativeMetadata.OrderedProcedures.Add(orderedProcedure);
```

## Creating and Configuring ModelConfiguration for Radiology Insights
To set up a `RadiologyInsightsModelConfiguration`, instantiate the configuration object and specify the locale, whether to include evidence, and the inference options. Additionally, define the expected response inference types by adding them to the `InferenceTypes` list. This configuration ensures that the radiology insights model is tailored to the specific requirements and expected outcomes of the analysis.
```C# Snippet:Critical_Result_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateModelConfiguration
RadiologyInsightsModelConfiguration radiologyInsightsModelConfiguration = new()
{
    Locale = "en-US",
    IncludeEvidence = true,
    InferenceOptions = radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions
};
radiologyInsightsModelConfiguration.InferenceTypes.Add(RadiologyInsightsInferenceType.CriticalResult);
```

## Adding Inference Options to ModelConfiguration for Radiology Insights
To configure the inference options for the radiology insights model, create instances of `RadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions`, `FollowupRecommendationOptions`, and `FindingOptions`. Set the desired properties for follow-up recommendations and findings, such as including recommendations with no specified modality, including recommendations in references, and providing focused sentence evidence. Assign these options to the `RadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions` object, ensuring that the model configuration is tailored to provide detailed and relevant insights.
```C# Snippet:Critical_Result_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateRadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions
RadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions = new();
FollowupRecommendationOptions followupRecommendationOptions = new();
FindingOptions findingOptions = new();
followupRecommendationOptions.IncludeRecommendationsWithNoSpecifiedModality = true;
followupRecommendationOptions.IncludeRecommendationsInReferences = true;
followupRecommendationOptions.ProvideFocusedSentenceEvidence = true;
findingOptions.ProvideFocusedSentenceEvidence = true;
radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions.FollowupRecommendationOptions = followupRecommendationOptions;
radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions.FindingOptions = findingOptions;
```

## Adding PatientRecord and ModelConfiguration to RadiologyInsightsData
To integrate the patient record and model configuration into `RadiologyInsightsData`, create a list of `PatientRecord` objects and initialize it with the patient record. Then, instantiate `RadiologyInsightsData` with this list. Finally, set the Configuration property of `RadiologyInsightsData` to the model configuration created using the `CreateConfiguration` method. This ensures that the data object is fully prepared with both patient information and the necessary configuration for radiology insights analysis.
```C# Snippet:Critical_Result_Sync_Tests_Samples_AddRecordAndConfiguration
List<PatientRecord> patientRecords = new() { patientRecord };
RadiologyInsightsData radiologyInsightsData = new(patientRecords);
radiologyInsightsData.Configuration = CreateConfiguration();
```

## Initializing RadiologyInsights Client with Default Azure Credentials
Create a `RadiologyInsightsClient` by initializing TokenCredential using the default Azure credentials.
```C# Snippet:Critical_Result_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateClient
Uri endpointUri = new Uri(endpoint);
TokenCredential cred = new DefaultAzureCredential();
RadiologyInsightsClient client = new RadiologyInsightsClient(endpointUri, cred);
```

## Sending Synchronous Requests with RadiologyInsights Client 
Send a synchronous request to the RadiologyInsights client along with the job id and radiologyInsightsjob.
```C# Snippet:Critical_Result_Sync_Tests_Samples_synccall
RadiologyInsightsJob radiologyInsightsjob = GetRadiologyInsightsJob();
var jobId = "job" + DateTimeOffset.Now.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds();
Operation<RadiologyInsightsInferenceResult> operation = client.InferRadiologyInsights(WaitUntil.Completed, jobId, radiologyInsightsjob);
```

## Displaying Critical Results from Radiology Insights
Below code is used to display information about critical results inferred from radiology insights. This is a specific type of inference that indicates a critical result has been found. If the inference is a CriticalResultInference, the code prints out a message indicating that a critical result inference has been found, along with the description of the result. This description provides more details about the critical result.

```C# Snippet:Critical_Result_Sync_Tests_Samples_CriticalResultInference
RadiologyInsightsInferenceResult responseData = operation.Value;
IReadOnlyList<RadiologyInsightsInference> inferences = responseData.PatientResults[0].Inferences;

foreach (RadiologyInsightsInference inference in inferences)
{
    if (inference is CriticalResultInference criticalResultInference)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Critical Result Inference found: " + criticalResultInference.Result.Description);
    }
}
```
