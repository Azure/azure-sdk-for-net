# How to extract a Quality Measure inference using a synchronous call

In this sample it is shown how you can construct a request, add a configuration, create a client, send a synchronous request and use the result returned to quality measure information from radiology reports.

## Creating a PatientRecord with Details, Encounter, and Document Content
To create a comprehensive patient record, instantiate a `PatientRecord` object with the patient’s details, encounter information, and document content. This record includes the patient’s birth date, sex, encounter class, period, and associated clinical documents, such as radiology reports. The `PatientRecord` object is then populated with these details to ensure all relevant patient information is accurately captured and organized.
```C# Snippet:Quality_Measure_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreatePatientRecord
string id = "patient_id2";
PatientDetails patientInfo = new()
{
    BirthDate = new System.DateTime(1959, 11, 11),
    Sex = PatientSex.Female,
};
PatientEncounter encounter = new("encounterid1")
{
    Class = EncounterClass.InPatient,
    Period = new TimePeriod
    {
        Start = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28),
        End = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28)
    }
};
List<PatientEncounter> encounterList = new() { encounter };
ClinicalDocumentContent documentContent = new(DocumentContentSourceType.Inline, DOC_CONTENT);
PatientDocument patientDocument = new(ClinicalDocumentContentType.Note, "doc2", documentContent)
{
    ClinicalType = ClinicalDocumentType.RadiologyReport,
    CreatedAt = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28),
    AdministrativeMetadata = CreateDocumentAdministrativeMetadata()
};
PatientRecord patientRecord = new(id);
patientRecord.Details = patientInfo;
patientRecord.Encounters.Add(encounter);
patientRecord.PatientDocuments.Add(patientDocument);
```

## Specifying Document Content for Patient Record
To define the document content for a patient record, create a constant string `DOC_CONTENT` that includes detailed clinical history, comparison, technique, findings, and impression sections. This content provides comprehensive information about the patient’s medical history, the techniques used in the examination, and the findings from the radiology report. This structured document content is essential for accurate and thorough patient records.
```C# Snippet:Quality_Measure_Sync_Tests_Samples_Doc_Content
private const string DOC_CONTENT = "inline\"," +
    "\r\n  value: `EXAM: CT CHEST WO CONTRAST" +
    "\r\n\r\nINDICATION: abnormal lung findings. History of emphysema." +
    "\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE: Helical CT images through the chest, without contrast. This exam was performed using one or more of the following dose reduction techniques: Automated exposure control, adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size, and/or use of iterative reconstruction technique. " +
    "\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON: Chest CT dated 6/21/2022." +
    "\r\nNumber of previous CT examinations or cardiac nuclear medicine (myocardial perfusion) examinations performed in the preceding 12-months: 2" +
    "\r\n\r\nFINDINGS:" +
    "\r\nHeart size is normal. No pericardial effusion. Thoracic aorta as well as pulmonary arteries are normal in caliber. There are dense coronary artery calcifications. No enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes by CT size criteria. Central airways are widely patent. No bronchial wall thickening. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. The previously identified posterior right upper lobe nodules are no longer seen. However, there are multiple new small pulmonary nodules. An 8 mm nodule in the right upper lobe, image #15 series 4. New posterior right upper lobe nodule measuring 6 mm, image #28 series 4. New 1.2 cm pulmonary nodule, right upper lobe, image #33 series 4. New 4 mm pulmonary nodule left upper lobe, image #22 series 4. New 8 mm pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe adjacent to the fissure, image #42 series 4. A few new tiny 2 to 3 mm pulmonary nodules are also noted in the left lower lobe. As before there is a background of severe emphysema. No evidence of pneumonia." +
    "\r\nLimited evaluation of the upper abdomen shows no concerning abnormality." +
    "\r\nReview of bone windows shows no aggressive appearing osseous lesions." +
    "\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPRESSION:" +
    "\r\n\r\n1. Previously identified small pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe have resolved, but there are multiple new small nodules scattered throughout both lungs. Recommend short-term follow-up with noncontrast chest CT in 3 months as per current  Current guidelines (2017 Fleischner Society)." +
    "\r\n2. Severe emphysema." +
    "\r\n\r\nFindings communicated to Dr. Jane Smith.`,";
```

## Creating Ordered Procedures for Patient Record
To add ordered procedures to a patient record, instantiate a `DocumentAdministrativeMetadata` object and create a `FhirR4Coding` object with the relevant procedure details. This includes the display name, code, and system. Then, create a `FhirR4CodeableConcept` object and add the coding to it. Finally, create an `OrderedProcedure` object with a description and code, and add it to the `OrderedProcedures` list of the `DocumentAdministrativeMetadata` object. This process ensures that the ordered procedures are accurately documented and associated with the patient record.
```C# Snippet:Quality_Measure_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateDocumentAdministrativeMetadata
DocumentAdministrativeMetadata documentAdministrativeMetadata = new DocumentAdministrativeMetadata();

FhirR4Coding coding = new()
{
    Display = "CT CHEST WO CONTRAST",
    Code = "CTCHWO",
    System = "http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt"
};

FhirR4CodeableConcept codeableConcept = new();
codeableConcept.Coding.Add(coding);

OrderedProcedure orderedProcedure = new()
{
    Description = "CT CHEST WO CONTRAST",
    Code = codeableConcept
};

documentAdministrativeMetadata.OrderedProcedures.Add(orderedProcedure);
```

## Creating and Configuring ModelConfiguration for Radiology Insights
To set up a `RadiologyInsightsModelConfiguration`, instantiate the configuration object and specify the locale, whether to include evidence, and the inference options. Additionally, define the expected response inference types by adding them to the `InferenceTypes` list. This configuration ensures that the radiology insights model is tailored to the specific requirements and expected outcomes of the analysis.
```C# Snippet:Quality_Measure_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateModelConfiguration
RadiologyInsightsModelConfiguration radiologyInsightsModelConfiguration = new()
{
    Locale = "en-US",
    IncludeEvidence = true,
    InferenceOptions = radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions
};
radiologyInsightsModelConfiguration.InferenceTypes.Add(RadiologyInsightsInferenceType.QualityMeasure);
```

## Adding Inference Options to ModelConfiguration for Radiology Insights
To configure the inference options for the radiology insights model, create instances of `RadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions`, `FollowupRecommendationOptions`, and `FindingOptions`. Set the desired properties for follow-up recommendations and findings, such as including recommendations with no specified modality, including recommendations in references, and providing focused sentence evidence. Assign these options to the `RadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions` object, ensuring that the model configuration is tailored to provide detailed and relevant insights.
```C# Snippet:Quality_Measure_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateRadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions
RadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions = new();
FollowupRecommendationOptions followupRecommendationOptions = new();
FindingOptions findingOptions = new();
var measureTypes = new[]
{
    QualityMeasureType.Mips364,
    QualityMeasureType.Mips360,
    QualityMeasureType.Mips436
};
QualityMeasureOptions qualityMeasureOptions = new(measureTypes);
followupRecommendationOptions.IncludeRecommendationsWithNoSpecifiedModality = true;
followupRecommendationOptions.IncludeRecommendationsInReferences = true;
followupRecommendationOptions.ProvideFocusedSentenceEvidence = true;
findingOptions.ProvideFocusedSentenceEvidence = true;
radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions.FollowupRecommendationOptions = followupRecommendationOptions;
radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions.FindingOptions = findingOptions;
radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions.QualityMeasureOptions = qualityMeasureOptions;
```

## Adding PatientRecord and ModelConfiguration to RadiologyInsightsData
To integrate the patient record and model configuration into `RadiologyInsightsData`, create a list of `PatientRecord` objects and initialize it with the patient record. Then, instantiate `RadiologyInsightsData` with this list. Finally, set the Configuration property of `RadiologyInsightsData` to the model configuration created using the `CreateConfiguration` method. This ensures that the data object is fully prepared with both patient information and the necessary configuration for radiology insights analysis.
```C# Snippet:Quality_Measure_Sync_Tests_Samples_AddRecordAndConfiguration
List<PatientRecord> patientRecords = new() { patientRecord };
RadiologyInsightsData radiologyInsightsData = new(patientRecords);
radiologyInsightsData.Configuration = CreateConfiguration();
```

## Initializing RadiologyInsights Client with Default Azure Credentials
Create a `RadiologyInsightsClient` by initializing TokenCredential using the default Azure credentials.
```C# Snippet:Quality_Measure_Sync_Tests_Samples_TokenCredential
Uri endpointUri = new Uri(endpoint);
TokenCredential cred = new DefaultAzureCredential();
RadiologyInsightsClient client = new RadiologyInsightsClient(endpointUri, cred);
```

## Sending Synchronous Requests with RadiologyInsights Client 
Send a synchronous request using the `RadiologyInsightsClient` along with the job id and radiologyInsightsjob.
```C# Snippet:Quality_Measure_Sync_Tests_Samples_synccall
RadiologyInsightsJob radiologyInsightsjob = GetRadiologyInsightsJob();
var jobId = "job" + DateTimeOffset.Now.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds();
Operation<RadiologyInsightsInferenceResult> operation = client.InferRadiologyInsights(WaitUntil.Completed, jobId, radiologyInsightsjob);
```

## Displaying Quality Measure Inferences from Radiology Insights
Below code processes quality measure inferences from radiology analysis results, extracting and displaying - quality measure denominator value, compliance type, list of quality criteria that were evaluated.
```C# Snippet:Quality_Measure_Sync_Tests_Samples_Quality_Measure_Inference
RadiologyInsightsInferenceResult responseData = operation.Value;
IReadOnlyList<RadiologyInsightsInference> inferences = responseData.PatientResults[0].Inferences;

foreach (RadiologyInsightsInference inference in inferences)
{
    if (inference is QualityMeasureInference qualityMeasureInference)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Quality Measure Inference found:");

        Console.WriteLine($"   Quality Measure Denominator: {qualityMeasureInference.QualityMeasureDenominator}");
        Console.WriteLine($"   Compliance Type: {qualityMeasureInference.ComplianceType}");

        IReadOnlyList<string> qualityCriterias = qualityMeasureInference.QualityCriteria;

        foreach (string qualityCriteria in qualityCriterias)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("   Quality Criterium: " + qualityCriteria);
        }
    }
}
```
