# How to extract the description of a followup communication inference using an asynchronous call

In this sample it is shown how you can construct a request, add a configuration, create a client, send an asynchronous request and use the result returned to extract the datetime, recipient and acknowledgement of the followup communication inference.

## Creating a PatientRecord with Details, Encounter, and Document Content
To create a comprehensive patient record, instantiate a `PatientRecord` object with the patient’s details, encounter information, and document content. This record includes the patient’s birth date, sex, encounter class, period, and associated clinical documents, such as radiology reports. The `PatientRecord` object is then populated with these details to ensure all relevant patient information is accurately captured and organized.
```C# Snippet:Followup_Communication_Async_Tests_Samples_CreatePatientRecord
string id = "patient_id2";
PatientDetails patientInfo = new()
{
    BirthDate = new System.DateTime(1959, 11, 11),
    Sex = PatientSex.Female,
};
PatientEncounter encounter = new("encounterid1")
{
    Class = EncounterClass.InPatient,
    Period = new TimePeriod
    {
        Start = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28),
        End = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28)
    }
};
List<PatientEncounter> encounterList = new() { encounter };
ClinicalDocumentContent documentContent = new(DocumentContentSourceType.Inline, DOC_CONTENT);
PatientDocument patientDocument = new(ClinicalDocumentContentType.Note, "doc2", documentContent)
{
    ClinicalType = ClinicalDocumentType.RadiologyReport,
    CreatedAt = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28),
    AdministrativeMetadata = CreateDocumentAdministrativeMetadata()
};
PatientRecord patientRecord = new(id);
patientRecord.Details = patientInfo;
patientRecord.Encounters.Add(encounter);
patientRecord.PatientDocuments.Add(patientDocument);
```

## Specifying Document Content for Patient Record
To define the document content for a patient record, create a constant string `DOC_CONTENT` that includes detailed clinical history, comparison, technique, findings, and impression sections. This content provides comprehensive information about the patient’s medical history, the techniques used in the examination, and the findings from the radiology report. This structured document content is essential for accurate and thorough patient records.
```C# Snippet:Followup_Communication_Async_Tests_Samples_Doc_Content
private const string DOC_CONTENT = "CLINICAL HISTORY:   "
    + "\r\n20-year-old female presenting with abdominal pain. Surgical history significant for appendectomy."
    + "\r\n "
    + "\r\nCOMPARISON:   "
    + "\r\nRight upper quadrant sonographic performed 1 day prior."
    + "\r\n "
    + "\r\nTECHNIQUE:   "
    + "\r\nTransabdominal grayscale pelvic sonography with duplex color Doppler "
    + "\r\nand spectral waveform analysis of the ovaries."
    + "\r\n "
    + "\r\nFINDINGS:   "
    + "\r\nThe uterus is unremarkable given the transabdominal technique with "
    + "\r\nendometrial echo complex within physiologic normal limits. The "
    + "\r\novaries are symmetric in size, measuring 2.5 x 1.2 x 3.0 cm and the "
    + "\r\nleft measuring 2.8 x 1.5 x 1.9 cm.\n \r\nOn duplex imaging, Doppler signal is symmetric."
    + "\r\n "
    + "\r\nIMPRESSION:   "
    + "\r\n1. Normal pelvic sonography. Findings of testicular torsion."
    + "\r\n\nA new US pelvis within the next 6 months is recommended."
    + "\n\nThese results have been discussed with Dr. Jones at 3 PM on November 5 2020.\n "
    + "\r\n";
```

## Creating Ordered Procedures for Patient Record
To add ordered procedures to a patient record, instantiate a `DocumentAdministrativeMetadata` object and create a `FhirR4Coding` object with the relevant procedure details. This includes the display name, code, and system. Then, create a `FhirR4CodeableConcept` object and add the coding to it. Finally, create an `OrderedProcedure` object with a description and code, and add it to the `OrderedProcedures` list of the `DocumentAdministrativeMetadata` object. This process ensures that the ordered procedures are accurately documented and associated with the patient record.
```C# Snippet:Followup_Communication_Async_Tests_Samples_CreateDocumentAdministrativeMetadata
DocumentAdministrativeMetadata documentAdministrativeMetadata = new DocumentAdministrativeMetadata();

FhirR4Coding coding = new()
{
    Display = "US PELVIS COMPLETE",
    Code = "USPELVIS",
    System = "Http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/cpt-all"
};

FhirR4CodeableConcept codeableConcept = new();
codeableConcept.Coding.Add(coding);

OrderedProcedure orderedProcedure = new()
{
    Description = "US PELVIS COMPLETE",
    Code = codeableConcept
};

documentAdministrativeMetadata.OrderedProcedures.Add(orderedProcedure);
```

## Creating and Configuring ModelConfiguration for Radiology Insights
To set up a `RadiologyInsightsModelConfiguration`, instantiate the configuration object and specify the locale, whether to include evidence, and the inference options. Additionally, define the expected response inference types by adding them to the `InferenceTypes` list. This configuration ensures that the radiology insights model is tailored to the specific requirements and expected outcomes of the analysis.
```C# Snippet:Followup_Communication_Async_Tests_Samples_CreateModelConfiguration
RadiologyInsightsModelConfiguration radiologyInsightsModelConfiguration = new()
{
    Locale = "en-US",
    IncludeEvidence = true,
    InferenceOptions = radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions
};
radiologyInsightsModelConfiguration.InferenceTypes.Add(RadiologyInsightsInferenceType.FollowupCommunication);
```

## Adding Inference Options to ModelConfiguration for Radiology Insights
To configure the inference options for the radiology insights model, create instances of `RadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions`, `FollowupRecommendationOptions`, and `FindingOptions`. Set the desired properties for follow-up recommendations and findings, such as including recommendations with no specified modality, including recommendations in references, and providing focused sentence evidence. Assign these options to the `RadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions` object, ensuring that the model configuration is tailored to provide detailed and relevant insights.
```C# Snippet:Followup_Communication_Async_Tests_Samples_CreateRadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions
RadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions = new();
FollowupRecommendationOptions followupRecommendationOptions = new();
FindingOptions findingOptions = new();
followupRecommendationOptions.IncludeRecommendationsWithNoSpecifiedModality = true;
followupRecommendationOptions.IncludeRecommendationsInReferences = true;
followupRecommendationOptions.ProvideFocusedSentenceEvidence = true;
findingOptions.ProvideFocusedSentenceEvidence = true;
radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions.FollowupRecommendationOptions = followupRecommendationOptions;
radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions.FindingOptions = findingOptions;
```

## Adding PatientRecord and ModelConfiguration to RadiologyInsightsData
To integrate the patient record and model configuration into `RadiologyInsightsData`, create a list of `PatientRecord` objects and initialize it with the patient record. Then, instantiate `RadiologyInsightsData` with this list. Finally, set the Configuration property of `RadiologyInsightsData` to the model configuration created using the `CreateConfiguration` method. This ensures that the data object is fully prepared with both patient information and the necessary configuration for radiology insights analysis.
```C# Snippet:Followup_Communication_Async_Tests_Samples_AddRecordAndConfiguration
List<PatientRecord> patientRecords = new() { patientRecord };
RadiologyInsightsData radiologyInsightsData = new(patientRecords);
radiologyInsightsData.Configuration = CreateConfiguration();
```

## Initializing RadiologyInsights Client with Default Azure Credentials
Create a `RadiologyInsightsClient` by initializing TokenCredential using the default Azure credentials.
```C# Snippet:Followup_Communication_Async_Tests_Samples_CreateClient
Uri endpointUri = new Uri(endpoint);
TokenCredential cred = new DefaultAzureCredential();
RadiologyInsightsClient client = new RadiologyInsightsClient(endpointUri, cred);
```

## Sending Asynchronous Requests with RadiologyInsights Client 
Send an asynchronous request to the `RadiologyInsightsClient` along with the job id and radiologyInsightsjob.
```C# Snippet:Followup_Communication_Async_Tests_Samples_synccall
RadiologyInsightsJob radiologyInsightsjob = GetRadiologyInsightsJob();
var jobId = "job" + DateTimeOffset.Now.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds();
Operation<RadiologyInsightsInferenceResult> operation = await client.InferRadiologyInsightsAsync(WaitUntil.Completed, jobId, radiologyInsightsjob);
```

## Displaying Follow-Up Communication Details
Following code is used to display information about a follow-up communication. It refers to a situation where the code has inferred that a follow-up communication has occurred based on the patient’s medical data. The code retrieves a list of dates and times when the communication occurred. These are represented as DateTimeOffset objects, which include both a date and time, and information about the time zone relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The code then prints out each date and time in the list. The code also retrieves a list of recipients of the communication. These are represented as MedicalProfessionalType objects, which could represent different types of healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses, or specialists. The code then prints out each recipient in the list. Finally, the code checks whether the communication was acknowledged and prints out this information. This could indicate whether the recipient of the communication has confirmed that they received and understood the communication. From the result loop over the inferences and display the datetime, recipient and acknowledgement of the followup communication inferences. 
```C# Snippet:Followup_Communication_Async_Tests_Samples_FollowupCommunicationInference
Console.WriteLine("Followup Communication Inference found");
Console.WriteLine("   Date/time: ");
IReadOnlyList<DateTimeOffset> dateTimeList = followupCommunicationInference.CommunicatedAt;
foreach (DateTimeOffset dateTime in dateTimeList)
{
    Console.WriteLine("      " + dateTime);
}
Console.WriteLine("   Recipient: ");
IReadOnlyList<MedicalProfessionalType> recipientList = followupCommunicationInference.Recipient;
foreach (MedicalProfessionalType recipient in recipientList)
{
    Console.WriteLine("      " + recipient);
}
Console.WriteLine("   Acknowledged: " + followupCommunicationInference.WasAcknowledged);
```
