# How to extract the description of a limited order inference using a synchronous call

In this sample it is shown how you can construct a request, add a configuration, create a client, send a synchronous request and use the result returned to extract the order type, missing body parts and missing body part measurements of the limited order inference.

## Create a PatientRecord with patient details, encounter and document content.

```C# Snippet:Limited_Order_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreatePatientRecord
string id = "patient_id2";
PatientDetails patientInfo = new()
{
    BirthDate = new System.DateTime(1959, 11, 11),
    Sex = PatientSex.Female,
};
PatientEncounter encounter = new("encounterid1")
{
    Class = EncounterClass.InPatient,
    Period = new TimePeriod
    {
        Start = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28),
        End = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28)
    }
};
List<PatientEncounter> encounterList = new() { encounter };
DocumentContent documentContent = new(DocumentContentSourceType.Inline, DOC_CONTENT);
PatientDocument patientDocument = new(DocumentType.Note, "doc2", documentContent)
{
    ClinicalType = ClinicalDocumentType.RadiologyReport,
    CreatedAt = new System.DateTime(2021, 08, 28),
    AdministrativeMetadata = CreateDocumentAdministrativeMetadata()
};
PatientRecord patientRecord = new(id);
patientRecord.Details = patientInfo;
patientRecord.Encounters.Add(encounter);
patientRecord.PatientDocuments.Add(patientDocument);
```

## For the patient record document specify the following document content.
```C# Snippet:Limited_Order_Sync_Tests_Samples_Doc_Content
private const string DOC_CONTENT = "\\nHISTORY: 49-year-old male with a history of tuberous sclerosis presenting with epigastric pain and diffuse tenderness. The patient was found to have pericholecystic haziness on CT; evaluation for acute cholecystitis.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE: Ultrasound evaluation of the abdomen was performed. Comparison is made to the prior abdominal ultrasound (2004) and to the enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis (2014).\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\nThe liver is elongated, measuring 19.3 cm craniocaudally, and is homogeneous in echotexture without evidence of focal mass lesion. The liver contour is smooth on high resolution images. There is no appreciable intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, with the visualized extrahepatic bile duct measuring up to 6 mm. There are multiple shadowing gallstones, including within the gallbladder neck, which do not appear particularly mobile. In addition, there is thickening of the gallbladder wall up to approximately 7 mm with probable mild mural edema. There is no pericholecystic fluid. No sonographic Murphy's sign was elicited; however the patient reportedly received pain medications in the emergency department.\\n\\nThe pancreatic head, body and visualized portions of the tail are unremarkable. The spleen is normal in size, measuring 9.9 cm in length.\\n\\nThe kidneys are normal in size. The right kidney measures 11.5 x 5.2 x 4.3 cm and the left kidney measuring 11.8 x 5.3 x 5.1 cm. There are again multiple bilateral echogenic renal masses consistent with angiomyolipomas, in keeping with the patient's history of tuberous sclerosis. The largest echogenic mass on the right is located in the upper pole and measures 1.2 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm. The largest echogenic mass on the left is located within the renal sinus and measures approximately 2.6 x 2.7 x 4.6 cm. Additional indeterminate renal lesions are present bilaterally and are better characterized on CT. There is no hydronephrosis.\\n\\nNo ascites is identified within the upper abdomen.\\n\\nThe visualized portions of the upper abdominal aorta and IVC are normal in caliber.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\n1. Numerous gallstones associated with gallbladder wall thickening and probable gallbladder mural edema, highly suspicious for acute cholecystitis in this patient presenting with epigastric pain and pericholecystic hazy density identified on CT. Although no sonographic Murphy sign was elicited, evaluation is limited secondary to reported prior administration of pain medication. Thus, clinical correlation is required. No evidence of biliary ductal dilation.\\n\\n2. There are again multiple bilateral echogenic renal masses consistent with angiomyolipomas, in keeping with the patient's history of tuberous sclerosis. Additional indeterminate renal lesions are present bilaterally and are better characterized on CT and MR.\\n\\nThese findings were discussed with Dr. Doe at 5:05 p.m. on 1/1/15.";
```

## For the patient record create ordered procedures.
```C# Snippet:Limited_Order_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateDocumentAdministrativeMetadata
DocumentAdministrativeMetadata documentAdministrativeMetadata = new DocumentAdministrativeMetadata();

FhirR4Coding coding = new()
{
    Display = "US ABDOMEN LIMITED",
    Code = "30704-1",
    System = "Http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/cpt-all"
};

FhirR4CodeableConcept codeableConcept = new();
codeableConcept.Coding.Add(coding);

OrderedProcedure orderedProcedure = new()
{
    Description = "US ABDOMEN LIMITED",
    Code = codeableConcept
};

documentAdministrativeMetadata.OrderedProcedures.Add(orderedProcedure);
```

## Create a ModelConfiguration

```C# Snippet:Limited_Order_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateModelConfiguration
RadiologyInsightsModelConfiguration radiologyInsightsModelConfiguration = new()
{
    Locale = "en-US",
    IncludeEvidence = true,
    InferenceOptions = radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions
};

radiologyInsightsModelConfiguration.InferenceTypes.Add(RadiologyInsightsInferenceType.LimitedOrderDiscrepancy);
```

## For the model configuration add the following inference options.
```C# Snippet:Limited_Order_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateRadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions
RadiologyInsightsInferenceOptions radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions = new();
FollowupRecommendationOptions followupRecommendationOptions = new();
FindingOptions findingOptions = new();
followupRecommendationOptions.IncludeRecommendationsWithNoSpecifiedModality = true;
followupRecommendationOptions.IncludeRecommendationsInReferences = true;
followupRecommendationOptions.ProvideFocusedSentenceEvidence = true;
findingOptions.ProvideFocusedSentenceEvidence = true;
radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions.FollowupRecommendationOptions = followupRecommendationOptions;
radiologyInsightsInferenceOptions.FindingOptions = findingOptions;
```

## Add the PatientRecord and the ModelConfiguration inside RadiologyInsightsData

```C# Snippet:Limited_Order_Sync_Tests_Samples_AddRecordAndConfiguration
List<PatientRecord> patientRecords = new() { patientRecord };
RadiologyInsightsData radiologyInsightsData = new(patientRecords);
radiologyInsightsData.Configuration = CreateConfiguration();
```

## Create a RadiologyInsights client

```C# Snippet:Limited_Order_Sync_Tests_Samples_CreateClient
Uri endpointUri = new Uri(endpoint);
AzureKeyCredential credential = new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey);
RadiologyInsightsClient client = new RadiologyInsightsClient(endpointUri, credential);
```

## Send a synchronous request to the RadiologyInsights client along with the job id and radiologyInsightsjob.

```C# Snippet:Limited_Order_Sync_Tests_Samples_synccall
RadiologyInsightsJob radiologyInsightsjob = GetRadiologyInsightsJob();
var jobId = "job" + DateTimeOffset.Now.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds();
Operation<RadiologyInsightsInferenceResult> operation = client.InferRadiologyInsights(WaitUntil.Completed, jobId, radiologyInsightsjob);
```

## Following code is used to display information about medical discrepancy found in a patientâ€™s order. The code retrieves the type of order that was placed. This could be a specific type of test or procedure that was ordered by a healthcare provider. The details of this order type, including its unique code and human-readable description, are then printed out. The code then retrieves a list of body parts that were present in the order but were not found or addressed during the procedure. For each of these missing body parts, the code prints out the details, including the unique code and human-readable description. Finally, the code retrieves a list of measurements for the missing body parts that were present in the order but were not taken or addressed during the procedure. For each of these missing measurements, the code prints out the details, including the unique code and human-readable description.

```C# Snippet:Limited_Order_Sync_Tests_Samples_LimitedOrderDiscrepancyInference
Console.Write("Limited Order Discrepancy Inference found: ");
FhirR4CodeableConcept orderType = limitedOrderDiscrepancyInference.OrderType;
DisplayCodes(orderType, 1);
IList<FhirR4CodeableConcept> missingBodyParts = limitedOrderDiscrepancyInference.PresentBodyParts;
Console.Write("   Present body parts:");
foreach (FhirR4CodeableConcept missingBodyPart in missingBodyParts)
{
    DisplayCodes(missingBodyPart, 2);
}
IList<FhirR4CodeableConcept> missingBodyPartMeasurements = limitedOrderDiscrepancyInference.PresentBodyPartMeasurements;
Console.Write("   Present body part measurements:");
foreach (FhirR4CodeableConcept missingBodyPartMeasurement in missingBodyPartMeasurements)
{
    DisplayCodes(missingBodyPartMeasurement, 2);
}
```

## Following code retrieves a list of medical codes from a codeableConcept object. Each of these codes is represented as a FhirR4Coding object, which is a part of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. If this list of codes is not empty, the system then goes through each code in the list. For each code, it prints out the following details:
- **The actual code itself, which is a unique identifier for a specific medical concept.**
- **The display text of the code, which is a human-readable representation of the medical concept that the code represents.**
- **The system that the code belongs to, which indicates the specific coding system that the code is a part of. This could be a widely recognized coding system like LOINC or SNOMED CT.**

```C# Snippet:Limited_Order_Sync_Tests_Samples_DisplayCodes
IList<FhirR4Coding> codingList = codeableConcept.Coding;
if (codingList != null)
{
    foreach (FhirR4Coding fhirR4Coding in codingList)
    {
        Console.Write(initialBlank + "Coding: " + fhirR4Coding.Code + ", " + fhirR4Coding.Display + " (" + fhirR4Coding.System + ")");
    }
}
```
