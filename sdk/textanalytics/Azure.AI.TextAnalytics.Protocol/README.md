# Azure REST Bindings for Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics client library for .NET

Azure.AI.TextAnalytics.Protocol is an experimental library for interacting directly with the REST endpoints for the Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics service.

At this time, if you are looking to interact with the Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics service, we recommend using the officialy supported [Azure.AI.TextAnalytics](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics) library.
