# Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics code sharing library

This library is intended to serve as a common location for non-public code for the legacy REST API that is used by the [Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics client library for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/textanalytics/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics).  The Text Analytics library includes these artifacts by shared links to enable them to be loosely hosted within those projects rather than consumed by direct project or package reference.
