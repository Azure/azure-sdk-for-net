# Recognizing Custom Named Entities from Documents

This sample demonstrates how to recognize custom entities in one or more documents. In order to use this feature, you need to train a model with your own data. For more information on how to do the training, see [train model][train_model].

## Create a `TextAnalyticsClient`

To create a new `TextAnalyticsClient`, you will need the service endpoint and credentials of your Language resource. To authenticate, you can use the [`DefaultAzureCredential`][DefaultAzureCredential], which combines credentials commonly used to authenticate when deployed on Azure, with credentials used to authenticate in a development environment. In this sample, however, you will use an `AzureKeyCredential`, which you can create with an API key.

```C# Snippet:CreateTextAnalyticsClient
Uri endpoint = new("<endpoint>");
AzureKeyCredential credential = new("<apiKey>");
TextAnalyticsClient client = new(endpoint, credential);
```

The values of the `endpoint` and `apiKey` variables can be retrieved from environment variables, configuration settings, or any other secure approach that works for your application.

## Recognizing custom entities in a single or multiple documents

To recognize custom entities in documents, set up a `RecognizeCustomEntitiesAction` and call `StartAnalyzeActionsAsync` on the documents. The result is a Long Running operation of type `AnalyzeActionsOperation` which polls for the results from the API. You can use [Azure language studio][azure_language_studio] to train custom models.

```C# Snippet:Sample8_RecognizeCustomEntitiesAsync
string documentA =
    "We love this trail and make the trip every year. The views are breathtaking and well worth the hike!"
    + " Yesterday was foggy though, so we missed the spectacular views. We tried again today and it was"
    + " amazing. Everyone in my family liked the trail although it was too challenging for the less"
    + " athletic among us.";

string documentB =
    "Last week we stayed at Hotel Foo to celebrate our anniversary. The staff knew about our anniversary"
    + " so they helped me organize a little surprise for my partner. The room was clean and with the"
    + " decoration I requested. It was perfect!";

// Prepare the input of the text analysis operation. You can add multiple documents to this list and
// perform the same operation on all of them simultaneously.
List<TextDocumentInput> batchedDocuments = new()
{
    new TextDocumentInput("1", documentA)
    {
         Language = "en",
    },
    new TextDocumentInput("2", documentB)
    {
         Language = "en",
    }
};

// Specify the project and deployment names of the desired custom model. To train your own custom model to
// recognize custom entities, see https://aka.ms/azsdk/textanalytics/customentityrecognition.
string projectName = "<projectName>";
string deploymentName = "<deploymentName>";
RecognizeCustomEntitiesAction recognizeCustomEntitiesAction = new(projectName, deploymentName);

TextAnalyticsActions actions = new()
{
    RecognizeCustomEntitiesActions = new List<RecognizeCustomEntitiesAction>() { recognizeCustomEntitiesAction }
};

// Perform the text analysis operation.
AnalyzeActionsOperation operation = await client.StartAnalyzeActionsAsync(batchedDocuments, actions);
await operation.WaitForCompletionAsync();
```

The returned `AnalyzeActionsOperation` contains general information about the status of the operation. It can be requested while the operation is running or when it has completed. For example:

```C# Snippet:Sample8_RecognizeCustomEntitiesAsync_ViewOperationStatus
// View the operation status.
Console.WriteLine($"Created On   : {operation.CreatedOn}");
Console.WriteLine($"Expires On   : {operation.ExpiresOn}");
Console.WriteLine($"Id           : {operation.Id}");
Console.WriteLine($"Status       : {operation.Status}");
Console.WriteLine($"Last Modified: {operation.LastModified}");
Console.WriteLine();
```

To view the final results of the long-running operation:

```C# Snippet:Sample8_RecognizeCustomEntitiesAsync_ViewResults
await foreach (AnalyzeActionsResult documentsInPage in operation.Value)
{
    IReadOnlyCollection<RecognizeCustomEntitiesActionResult> customEntitiesActionResults = documentsInPage.RecognizeCustomEntitiesResults;
    foreach (RecognizeCustomEntitiesActionResult customEntitiesActionResult in customEntitiesActionResults)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Action name: {customEntitiesActionResult.ActionName}");

        foreach (RecognizeEntitiesResult documentResult in customEntitiesActionResult.DocumentsResults)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Result for document with Id = \"{documentResult.Id}\":");

            if (documentResult.HasError)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"  Error!");
                Console.WriteLine($"  Document error code: {documentResult.Error.ErrorCode}");
                Console.WriteLine($"  Message: {documentResult.Error.Message}");
                Console.WriteLine();
                continue;
            }

            Console.WriteLine($"  Recognized {documentResult.Entities.Count} entities:");

            foreach (CategorizedEntity entity in documentResult.Entities)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"  Entity: {entity.Text}");
                Console.WriteLine($"  Category: {entity.Category}");
                Console.WriteLine($"  Offset: {entity.Offset}");
                Console.WriteLine($"  Length: {entity.Length}");
                Console.WriteLine($"  ConfidenceScore: {entity.ConfidenceScore}");
                Console.WriteLine($"  SubCategory: {entity.SubCategory}");
                Console.WriteLine();
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
```
