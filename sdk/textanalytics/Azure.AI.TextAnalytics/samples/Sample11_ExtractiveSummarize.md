# Summarize documents with extractive summarization

This sample demonstrates how to perform extractive summarization, which can generate a summary from a text document by extracting sentences verbatim from it that collectively represent the most important or relevant information. To learn more about document summarization, see [here][Document_Summarization].

## Create a `TextAnalyticsClient`

To create a new `TextAnalyticsClient`, you will need the service endpoint and credentials of your Language resource. To authenticate, you can use the [`DefaultAzureCredential`][DefaultAzureCredential], which combines credentials commonly used to authenticate when deployed on Azure, with credentials used to authenticate in a development environment. In this sample, however, you will use an `AzureKeyCredential`, which you can create with an API key.

```C# Snippet:CreateTextAnalyticsClient
Uri endpoint = new("<endpoint>");
AzureKeyCredential credential = new("<apiKey>");
TextAnalyticsClient client = new(endpoint, credential);
```

The values of the `endpoint` and `apiKey` variables can be retrieved from environment variables, configuration settings, or any other secure approach that works for your application.

## Summarize one or more text documents

To summarize one or more text documents using extractive summarization, call `ExtractiveSummarize` on the `TextAnalyticsClient` by passing the documents as either an `IEnumerable<string>` parameter or an `IEnumerable<TextDocumentInput>` parameter. This returns an `ExtractiveSummarizeOperation`.

```C# Snippet:Sample11_ExtractiveSummarizeConvenienceAsync
string document =
    "Windows 365 was in the works before COVID-19 sent companies around the world on a scramble to secure"
    + " solutions to support employees suddenly forced to work from home, but “what really put the"
    + " firecracker behind it was the pandemic, it accelerated everything,” McKelvey said. She explained"
    + " that customers were asking, “How do we create an experience for people that makes them still feel"
    + " connected to the company without the physical presence of being there?” In this new world of"
    + " Windows 365, remote workers flip the lid on their laptop, boot up the family workstation or clip a"
    + " keyboard onto a tablet, launch a native app or modern web browser and login to their Windows 365"
    + " account. From there, their Cloud PC appears with their background, apps, settings and content just"
    + " as they left it when they last were last there – in the office, at home or a coffee shop. And"
    + " then, when you’re done, you’re done. You won’t have any issues around security because you’re not"
    + " saving anything on your device,” McKelvey said, noting that all the data is stored in the cloud."
    + " The ability to login to a Cloud PC from anywhere on any device is part of Microsoft’s larger"
    + " strategy around tailoring products such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 for the post-pandemic"
    + " hybrid workforce of the future, she added. It enables employees accustomed to working from home to"
    + " continue working from home; it enables companies to hire interns from halfway around the world; it"
    + " allows startups to scale without requiring IT expertise. “I think this will be interesting for"
    + " those organizations who, for whatever reason, have shied away from virtualization. This is giving"
    + " them an opportunity to try it in a way that their regular, everyday endpoint admin could manage,”"
    + " McKelvey said. The simplicity of Windows 365 won over Dean Wells, the corporate chief information"
    + " officer for the Government of Nunavut. His team previously attempted to deploy a traditional"
    + " virtual desktop infrastructure and found it inefficient and unsustainable given the limitations of"
    + " low-bandwidth satellite internet and the constant need for IT staff to manage the network and"
    + " infrastructure. We didn’t run it for very long,” he said. “It didn’t turn out the way we had"
    + " hoped. So, we actually had terminated the project and rolled back out to just regular PCs.” He"
    + " re-evaluated this decision after the Government of Nunavut was hit by a ransomware attack in"
    + " November 2019 that took down everything from the phone system to the government’s servers."
    + " Microsoft helped rebuild the system, moving the government to Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive and"
    + " Microsoft 365. Manchester’s team recruited the Government of Nunavut to pilot Windows 365. Wells"
    + " was intrigued, especially by the ability to manage the elastic workforce securely and seamlessly."
    + " “The impact that I believe we are finding, and the impact that we’re going to find going forward,"
    + " is being able to access specialists from outside the territory and organizations outside the"
    + " territory to come in and help us with our projects, being able to get people on staff with us to"
    + " help us deliver the day-to-day expertise that we need to run the government,” he said. “Being able"
    + " to improve healthcare, being able to improve education, economic development is going to improve"
    + " the quality of life in the communities.”";

// Prepare the input of the text analysis operation. You can add multiple documents to this list and
// perform the same operation on all of them simultaneously.
List<string> batchedDocuments = new()
{
    document
};

// Perform the text analysis operation.
ExtractiveSummarizeOperation operation = client.ExtractiveSummarize(WaitUntil.Completed, batchedDocuments);
```

Using `WaitUntil.Completed` means that the long-running operation will be automatically polled until it has completed. You can then view the results of the extractive summarization, including any errors that might have occurred:

```C# Snippet:Sample11_ExtractiveSummarizeConvenienceAsync_ViewResults
// View the operation results.
await foreach (ExtractiveSummarizeResultCollection documentsInPage in operation.Value)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Extractive Summarize, version: \"{documentsInPage.ModelVersion}\"");
    Console.WriteLine();

    foreach (ExtractiveSummarizeResult documentResult in documentsInPage)
    {
        if (documentResult.HasError)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  Error!");
            Console.WriteLine($"  Document error code: {documentResult.Error.ErrorCode}");
            Console.WriteLine($"  Message: {documentResult.Error.Message}");
            continue;
        }

        Console.WriteLine($"  Extracted {documentResult.Sentences.Count} sentence(s):");
        Console.WriteLine();

        foreach (ExtractiveSummarySentence sentence in documentResult.Sentences)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  Sentence: {sentence.Text}");
            Console.WriteLine($"  Rank Score: {sentence.RankScore}");
            Console.WriteLine($"  Offset: {sentence.Offset}");
            Console.WriteLine($"  Length: {sentence.Length}");
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
```
