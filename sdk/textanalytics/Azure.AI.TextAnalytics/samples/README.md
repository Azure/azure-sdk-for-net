  * Key Phrase Extraction
  * Entity Recognition (Named, Linked, and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities)
  * Healthcare Entities Recognition
  * Extractive Text Summarization
  * Custom Named Entity Recognition
* Classify Text: Use NLU to detect the language, analyze sentiment, or classify the text you have
  * Language Detection
  * Sentiment Analysis
  * Custom Text Classification
