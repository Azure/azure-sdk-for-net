# Azure Text Analytics client SDK Samples
Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics is one of the three services that are part of the Azure Cognitive Service for Language. This client library includes the following main features:

* Extract Information: Use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to extract information from unstructured text. For example:
  * Key Phrase Extraction
  * Entity Recognition (Named, Linked, and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities)
  * Healthcare Entities Recognition
  * Extractive Text Summarization
  * Custom Named Entity Recognition
* Classify Text: Use NLU to detect the language, analyze sentiment, or classify the text you have
  * Language Detection
  * Sentiment Analysis
  * Custom Text Classification
