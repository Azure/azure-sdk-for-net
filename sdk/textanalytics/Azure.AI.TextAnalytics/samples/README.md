# Azure Text Analytics client SDK Samples
Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics is a cloud service that provides advanced natural language processing over raw text, and includes the following main functions: 
* Language Detection
* Sentiment Analysis
* Key Phrase Extraction
* Named Entity Recognition
* Linked Entity Recognition

You can find samples for each of this main functions below, as well as a sample on how to create a mock client for testing purposes.
To get started you'll need a Text Analytics endpoint and credentials. See Text Analytics Client Library [Readme][README] for more information and instructions.
