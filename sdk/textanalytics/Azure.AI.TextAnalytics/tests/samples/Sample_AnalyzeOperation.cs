                                worth the hike! Yesterday was foggy though, so we missed the spectacular views.
                                We tried again today and it was amazing. Everyone in my family liked the trail although
                                it was too challenging for the less athletic among us.
                                Not necessarily recommended for small children.

                                The spa offered couples massages which were really good. 
                                The spa was clean and felt very peaceful. Overall the whole experience was great.
