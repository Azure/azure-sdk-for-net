# Translation Operations History
This sample demonstrates how to get the history for all submitted translation operations on your Translator resource. To get started you will need a Translator endpoint and credentials.  See [README][README] for links and instructions.

## Creating a `DocumentTranslationClient`

To create a new `DocumentTranslationClient` to run a translation operation for documents, you need a Translator endpoint and credentials. You can use the [DefaultAzureCredential][DefaultAzureCredential] to try a number of common authentication methods optimized for both running as a service and development. In the sample below, you'll use a Translator API key credential by creating an `AzureKeyCredential` object, that if needed, will allow you to update the API key without creating a new client.

You can set `endpoint` and `apiKey` based on an environment variable, a configuration setting, or any way that works for your application.

```C# Snippet:CreateDocumentTranslationClient
string endpoint = "<endpoint>";
string apiKey = "<apiKey>";
var client = new DocumentTranslationClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));
```

## Getting all submitted translation operations

To get the Translation History, call `GetTranslationsAsync` which returns an AsyncPageable object containing the `TranslationStatusResult` for all submitted translation operations.

The sample below gets the total number of documents translated in all submitted operations as well as the details of the operation continuing the largest number of documents.

```C# Snippet:OperationsHistoryAsync
int operationsCount = 0;
int totalDocs = 0;
int docsCancelled = 0;
int docsSucceeded = 0;
int docsFailed = 0;

await foreach (TranslationStatus translationStatus in client.GetAllTranslationStatusesAsync())
{
    if (translationStatus.Status == DocumentTranslationStatus.NotStarted ||
        translationStatus.Status == DocumentTranslationStatus.Running)
    {
        DocumentTranslationOperation operation = new DocumentTranslationOperation(translationStatus.Id, client);
        await operation.WaitForCompletionAsync();
    }

    operationsCount++;
    totalDocs += translationStatus.DocumentsTotal;
    docsCancelled += translationStatus.DocumentsCancelled;
    docsSucceeded += translationStatus.DocumentsSucceeded;
    docsFailed += translationStatus.DocumentsFailed;
}

Console.WriteLine($"# of operations: {operationsCount}");
Console.WriteLine($"Total Documents: {totalDocs}");
Console.WriteLine($"Succeeded Document: {docsSucceeded}");
Console.WriteLine($"Failed Document: {docsFailed}");
Console.WriteLine($"Cancelled Documents: {docsCancelled}");
```
