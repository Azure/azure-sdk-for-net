DO prefix namespace names with a company name to prevent namespaces from different companies from having the same name.
AVOID very deep namespace hierarchies. Such hierarchies are difficult to browse because the user has to backtrack often.
AVOID having too many namespaces.
DO NOT define types without specifying their namespaces.
