# Azure Container Registry performance tests

This folder contains performance tests for the [Azure Container Registry client library for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/containerregistry/Azure.Containers.ContainerRegistry) and its associated ecosystem.  The artifacts in this library are intended to be used primarily with the Azure SDK engineering system's testing infrastructure, but may also be run as stand-alone applications from the command line.
