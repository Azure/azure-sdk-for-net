# Analyze healthcare entities

This sample demonstrates how to analyze healthcare entities in one or more documents.

## Create a `TextAnalysisClient`

To create a new `TextAnalysisClient`, you will need the service endpoint and credentials of your Language resource. To authenticate, you can use the [`DefaultAzureCredential`][DefaultAzureCredential], which combines credentials commonly used to authenticate when deployed on Azure, with credentials used to authenticate in a development environment. In this sample, however, you will use an `AzureKeyCredential`, which you can create with an API key.

```C# Snippet:CreateTextAnalysisClientForSpecificApiVersion
Uri endpoint = new Uri("https://myaccount.cognitiveservices.azure.com");
AzureKeyCredential credential = new("your apikey");
TextAnalysisClientOptions options = new TextAnalysisClientOptions(TextAnalysisClientOptions.ServiceVersion.V2023_04_01);
var client = new TextAnalysisClient(endpoint, credential, options);
```

The values of the `endpoint` and `apiKey` variables can be retrieved from environment variables, configuration settings, or any other secure approach that works for your application.

## Analyze healthcare entities in one or more text documents

To analyze healthcare entities in one or more text documents, call `AnalyzeTextOperationAsync` on the `TextAnalysisClient` by passing the documents as `MultiLanguageTextInput` parameter and a `AnalyzeTextOperationAction` with a `HealthcareOperationAction` action. This returns an `Response<AnalyzeTextOperationState>` which you can extract the `HealthcareOperationResult`.

```C# Snippet:Sample7_AnalyzeTextOperationAsync_HealthcareOperationAction
string textA =
    "RECORD #333582770390100 | MH | 85986313 | | 054351 | 2/14/2001 12:00:00 AM |"
    + " CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE | Signed | DIS |"
    + Environment.NewLine
    + " Admission Date: 5/22/2001 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 4/24/2001"
    + " ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE."
    + Environment.NewLine
    + " HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54-year-old gentleman with a history of progressive"
    + " angina over the past several months. The patient had a cardiac catheterization in July of this"
    + " year revealing total occlusion of the RCA and 50% left main disease, with a strong family history"
    + " of coronary artery disease with a brother dying at the age of 52 from a myocardial infarction and"
    + " another brother who is status post coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient had a stress"
    + " echocardiogram done on July, 2001, which showed no wall motion abnormalities, but this was a"
    + " difficult study due to body habitus. The patient went for six minutes with minimal ST depressions"

// Prepare the input of the text analysis operation. You can add multiple documents to this list and
// perform the same operation on all of them simultaneously.
MultiLanguageTextInput multiLanguageTextInput = new MultiLanguageTextInput()
{
    MultiLanguageInputs =
    {
        new MultiLanguageInput("A", textA) { Language = "en" },
        new MultiLanguageInput("B", textB) { Language = "en" },
    }
};
