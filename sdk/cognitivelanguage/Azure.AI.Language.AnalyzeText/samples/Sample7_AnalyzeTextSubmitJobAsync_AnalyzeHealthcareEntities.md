# Analyze healthcare entities

This sample demonstrates how to analyze healthcare entities in one or more documents.

## Create a `AnalyzeTextClient`

To create a new `AnalyzeTextClient`, you will need the service endpoint and credentials of your Language resource. To authenticate, you can use the [`DefaultAzureCredential`][DefaultAzureCredential], which combines credentials commonly used to authenticate when deployed on Azure, with credentials used to authenticate in a development environment. In this sample, however, you will use an `AzureKeyCredential`, which you can create with an API key.

```C# Snippet:CreateAnalyzeTextClient
Uri endpoint = TestEnvironment.Endpoint;
AzureKeyCredential credential = new(TestEnvironment.ApiKey);
Language client = new AnalyzeTextClient(endpoint, credential).GetLanguageClient(apiVersion: "2023-04-01");
```

The values of the `endpoint` and `apiKey` variables can be retrieved from environment variables, configuration settings, or any other secure approach that works for your application.

## Analyze healthcare entities in one or more text documents

To analyze healthcare entities in one or more text documents, call `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesAsync` on the `TextAnalyticsClient` by passing the documents as either an `IEnumerable<string>` parameter or an `IEnumerable<TextDocumentInput>` parameter. This returns an `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesOperation`.

```C# Snippet:Sample7_AnalyzeTextSubmitJobAsync_HealthcareLROTask_PerformOperation
string documentA =
    "RECORD #333582770390100 | MH | 85986313 | | 054351 | 2/14/2001 12:00:00 AM |"
    + " CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE | Signed | DIS |"
    + Environment.NewLine
    + " Admission Date: 5/22/2001 Report Status: Signed Discharge Date: 4/24/2001"
    + " ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE."
    + Environment.NewLine
    + " HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 54-year-old gentleman with a history of progressive"
    + " angina over the past several months. The patient had a cardiac catheterization in July of this"
    + " year revealing total occlusion of the RCA and 50% left main disease, with a strong family history"
    + " of coronary artery disease with a brother dying at the age of 52 from a myocardial infarction and"
    + " another brother who is status post coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient had a stress"
    + " echocardiogram done on July, 2001, which showed no wall motion abnormalities, but this was a"
    + " difficult study due to body habitus. The patient went for six minutes with minimal ST depressions"
    + " in the anterior lateral leads, thought due to fatigue and wrist pain, his anginal equivalent. Due"
    + " to the patient'sincreased symptoms and family history and history left main disease with total"
    + " occasional of his RCA was referred for revascularization with open heart surgery.";

string documentB = "Prescribed 100mg ibuprofen, taken twice daily.";

// Prepare the input of the text analysis operation. You can add multiple documents to this list and
// perform the same operation on all of them simultaneously.
MultiLanguageAnalysisInput multiLanguageAnalysisInput = new MultiLanguageAnalysisInput()
{
    Documents =
        {
            new MultiLanguageInput("A", documentA, "en"),
            new MultiLanguageInput("B", documentB, "en"),
        }
};

AnalyzeTextJobsInput analyzeTextJobsInput = new AnalyzeTextJobsInput(multiLanguageAnalysisInput, new AnalyzeTextLROTask[]
{
    new HealthcareLROTask()
});

Operation operation = await client.AnalyzeTextSubmitJobAsync(WaitUntil.Completed, analyzeTextJobsInput);
```

Using `WaitUntil.Completed` means that the long-running operation will be automatically polled until it has completed. You can then view the results of the healthcare entities analysis, including any errors that might have occurred:

```C# Snippet:Sample7_AnalyzeTextSubmitJob_HealthcareLROTask_ViewResults
AnalyzeTextJobState analyzeTextJobState = AnalyzeTextJobState.FromResponse(operation.GetRawResponse());

foreach (AnalyzeTextLROResult analyzeTextLROResult in analyzeTextJobState.Tasks.Items)
{
    if (analyzeTextLROResult.Kind == AnalyzeTextLROResultsKind.HealthcareLROResults)
    {
        HealthcareLROResult healthcareLROResult = (HealthcareLROResult)analyzeTextLROResult;
        Console.WriteLine($"Analyze Healthcare Entities, model version: \"{healthcareLROResult.Results.ModelVersion}\"");
        Console.WriteLine();

        // View the healthcare entities recognized in the input documents.
        foreach (HealthcareEntitiesDocumentResultWithDocumentDetectedLanguage healthcareEntitiesDocument in healthcareLROResult.Results.Documents)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Result for document with Id = \"{healthcareEntitiesDocument.Id}\":");
            Console.WriteLine($"  Recognized the following {healthcareEntitiesDocument.Entities.Count} healthcare entities:");
            foreach (HealthcareEntity healthcareEntity in healthcareEntitiesDocument.Entities)

                    }
                }
            }

            Console.WriteLine($"  We found {healthcareEntitiesDocument.Relations.Count} relations in the current document:");
            Console.WriteLine();

            // View the healthcare entity relations that were recognized.
            foreach (HealthcareRelation relation in healthcareEntitiesDocument.Relations)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"    Relation: {relation.RelationType}");
                if (relation.ConfidenceScore is not null)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"    ConfidenceScore: {relation.ConfidenceScore}");
                }
                Console.WriteLine($"    For this relation there are {relation.Entities.Count} roles");
