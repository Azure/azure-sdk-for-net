# Azure Cognitive Language Services Question Answering client library for .NET

The Question Answering service is a cloud-based API service that lets you create a conversational question-and-answer layer over your existing data. Use it to build a knowledge base by extracting questions and answers from your semi-structured content, including FAQ, manuals, and documents. Answer users’ questions with the best answers from the QnAs in your knowledge base—automatically. Your knowledge base gets smarter, too, as it continually learns from user behavior.

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Cognitive Language Services Question Answering client library for .NET with [NuGet][nuget]:

```powershell
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Language.QuestionAnswering --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites

* An [Azure subscription][azure_subscription]
* An existing Question Answering resource

> Note: the new unified Cognitive Language Services are not currently available for deployment.

### Authenticate the client

In order to interact with the Question Answering service, you'll need to create an instance of the [`QuestionAnsweringClient`][questionanswering_client_class] class. You will need an **endpoint**, and an **API key** to instantiate a client object. For more information regarding authenticating with Cognitive Services, see [Authenticate requests to Azure Cognitive Services][cognitive_auth].

#### Get an API key

You can get the **endpoint** and an **API key** from the Cognitive Services resource or Question Answering resource in the [Azure Portal][azure_portal].

Alternatively, use the [Azure CLI][azure_cli] command shown below to get the API key from the Question Answering resource.

```powershell
az cognitiveservices account keys list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <resource-name>
```

#### Create a QuestionAnsweringClient

Once you've determined your **endpoint** and **API key** you can instantiate a `QuestionAnsweringClient`:

```C# Snippet:QuestionAnsweringClient_Create
Uri endpoint = new Uri("https://myaccount.api.cognitive.microsoft.com");
AzureKeyCredential credential = new AzureKeyCredential("{api-key}");

QuestionAnsweringClient client = new QuestionAnsweringClient(endpoint, credential);
```

## Key concepts

### QuestionAnsweringClient

The [`QuestionAnsweringClient`][questionanswering_client_class] is the primary interface for asking questions using a knowledge base with your own information, or text input using pre-trained models. It provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs to ask questions.

### Thread safety

We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples

The Azure.AI.Language.QuestionAnswering client library provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs.

The following examples show common scenarios using the `client` [created above](#create-a-questionansweringclient).

### Ask a question

The only input required to a ask a question using an existing knowledge base is just the question itself:

```C# Snippet:QuestionAnsweringClient_QueryKnowledgebase
KnowledgebaseQueryOptions options = new KnowledgebaseQueryOptions("How long should my Surface battery last?");

Response<KnowledgebaseAnswers> response = client.QueryKnowledgebase("FAQ", options);

foreach (KnowledgebaseAnswer answer in response.Value.Answers)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"({answer.ConfidenceScore:P2}) {answer.Answer}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Source: {answer.Source}");
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

You can set additional properties on `QuestionAnsweringClientOptions` to limit the number of answers, specify a minimum confidence score, and more.

### Ask a follow-up question

If your knowledge base is configured for [chit-chat][questionanswering_docs_chat], you can ask a follow-up question provided the previous question-answering ID and, optionally, the exact question the user asked:

```C# Snippet:QuestionAnsweringClient_Chat
// Answers are ordered by their ConfidenceScore so assume the user choose the first answer below:
KnowledgebaseAnswer previousAnswer = answers.Answers.First();
KnowledgebaseQueryOptions options = new KnowledgebaseQueryOptions("How long should charging take?")
{
    Context = new KnowledgebaseAnswerRequestContext(previousAnswer.Id.Value)
};

Response<KnowledgebaseAnswers> response = client.QueryKnowledgebase("FAQ", options);

foreach (KnowledgebaseAnswer answer in response.Value.Answers)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"({answer.ConfidenceScore:P2}) {answer.Answer}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Source: {answer.Source}");
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### General

When you interact with the Cognitive Language Services Question Answering client library using the .NET SDK, errors returned by the service correspond to the same HTTP status codes returned for [REST API][questionanswering_rest_docs] requests.

For example, if you submit a question to a non-existant knowledge base, a `400` error is returned indicating "Bad Request".

```C# Snippet:QuestionAnsweringClient_BadRequest
try
{
    Response<KnowledgebaseAnswers> response = client.QueryKnowledgebase("invalid-knowledgebase", options);
}
catch (RequestFailedException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
}
```

You will notice that additional information is logged, like the client request ID of the operation.

```text
Azure.RequestFailedException: Please verify azure search service is up, restart the WebApp and try again
Status: 400 (Bad Request)
ErrorCode: BadArgument

Content:
{
    "error": {
    "code": "BadArgument",
    "message": "Please verify azure search service is up, restart the WebApp and try again"
    }
}

Headers:
x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 23

```

### Setting up console logging

The simplest way to see the logs is to enable console logging. To create an Azure SDK log listener that outputs messages to the console use the `AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger` method.

```C#
// Setup a listener to monitor logged events.
using AzureEventSourceListener listener = AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger();
```

To learn more about other logging mechanisms see [here][core_logging].
