It can take longer if you\u2019re using your Surface for power-intensive activities like gaming or video streaming while you\u2019re charging it.\\n\\nYou can use the USB port on your Surface Pro 4 power supply to charge other devices, like a phone, while your Surface charges. The USB port on the power supply is only for charging, not for data transfer. If you want to use a USB device, plug it into the USB port on your Surface.\u0022,\n",
