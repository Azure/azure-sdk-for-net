# Azure.AI.Language.Conversations Samples

Conversation Analysis is a cloud-based conversational AI service that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information.

You can work with request and response content more easily by using our [Dynamic JSON](https://aka.ms/azsdk/net/dynamiccontent) feature. This is illustrated in the following samples:
