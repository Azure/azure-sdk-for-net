Source files in this directory are written as tests from which samples are extracted.
They are not intended to be viewed directly and help ensure our samples compile and work correctly.
See our [list of samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/cognitivelanguage/Azure.AI.Language.QuestionAnswering/samples) for more explanation about how to use this client library.
