#### Sushi Rice (Shari) adapted from Sushi Made Easy by K. Wong

Ingredients: 2 cups sushi rice or short-grain rice 2 ½ cups cold water (or amount of water suggested on rice package if different for 2 cups of rice)

Vinegar Mixture 4 tbsp. rice vinegar 2 tbsp. sugar 1/2 tsp. salt

Directions:

Wash the rice until water runs clear (do not skip this step, it is essential in achieving the correct consistency to work with your rice).

2. Place the rice in a pot with a tight fitting lid and add the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. 3. Lower heat and steam for 12 to 15 minutes.

4. Remove from heat and remove lid. Cover pot with a tea or dish towel. Let stand for 15 minutes.

5. While rice is cooking, combine vinegar mixture ingredients in a saucepan, and heat gently until sugar dissolves, stirring constantly. Remove the mixture from heat and let cool.

6. Spread the rice evenly in the bottom of a shallow, preferably wooden, bowl. Run a spatula or rice paddle through the rice using a chopping, rather than stirring, motion to gently separate the grains and slowly add vinegar mixture at the same time.

7. Fan the rice until it reaches room temperature. Keep the rice in the bowl, covered with a clean dish towel, until ready to use.

Makes enough for about small 10 rolls. A rice cooker can also be used instead of cooking rice on stove.

#### Rolling Maki from Sushi Made Easy by K. Wong

Ingredients:

Shari (vinegared rice), room temperature 5 sheets of nori small bowl of water with a dash of rice vinegar in it wasabi paste your choice of fillings (fish, vegetables, meat, etc.)

Directions:

1.  Cut a sheet of nori crosswise into two pieces if using one filling ingredient, or leave whole if making roll with more than one filling.

2.  Place one half of the nori shiny-side down on the surface of the bamboo rolling mat.   The rolling mat should be dry and placed on a dry surface such as a cutting board.

3.  Moisten your hands in vinegared water and make a loosely formed ball out of about a half of a cup of prepared vinegared rice.

4.  Place the ball on the nori and spread it out carefully without smashing it into the nori.  Keep about ½ inch free of rice on the far end.

5.  At the end closest to you, dab a thin line of wasabi on the rice then place ingredients on top.  Moisten strip of nori not covered with rice at other end.

6.  Lift the end of the mat closest to you.  Roll by pressing the mat firmly on the nori.  Be careful not to roll the mat into the sushi.  The nori will stick to itself when the roll is complete. 

7.  Let the roll rest for a minute or two then slice into even pieces with moistened knife.

#### 10-Minute Miso Soup from steamykitchen.com 

Ingredients: 4 cups water 1 1/2 teaspoons instant dashi granules 1/2 cup miso paste (any variety will work, but Shiro, also called ‘light miso,’ is preferred) 1 tablespoon dried seaweed (wakame works well), soaked in water for 5 minutes 1/2 cup cubed firm tofu 2 tablespoons chopped green onion

Directions: 1. Pour the water into a pot and bring to a boil. Add the instant dashi and whisk to dissolve. Turn the heat to medium-low and add the tofu. Drain the seaweed and add the seaweed to the pot. Simmer for 2 minutes.
