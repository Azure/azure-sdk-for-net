## SUSHI

### Six Easy Steps

#### Step 2

Using a spoon or chopsticks, make a shallow groove in the rice, near the center, and arrange the condiments and fillings in lengthwise rows across the rice.

#### Step 4

Continue rolling, tucking nori over the fillings, while pulling the mat back as you roll. Wet nori end with moistened fingers and continue rolling. Wrap mat completely around roll and gently squeeze to seal. Firm up ends of roll by pressing with fingers.

#### Step 6

Moistening the knife before each slicing, slice each half in half, then each quarter in half. Each roll makes eight equal-size pieces of sushi.

##### Practice makes perfect.

Step 1 Place smooth, shiny side of nori sheet down on a sushi mat. Dip rice paddle or wooden spatula in water. Spread 1 cup cooked rice over nori, leaving 1" at the bottom and 3" at the top uncovered. Moisten paddle and press firmly on rice to spread evenly.

#### Step 3

Dip fingers in water. Place thumbs behind the sushi mat and hold the fillings in place with fingers. Begin rolling forward in a jelly roll fashion.

#### Step 5

Remove sushi mat. Place roll seam side down on a cutting surface. Lightly moisten knife before each slicing for evenly cut sushi and to prevent tearing of nori. Hold roll firmly, but do not squeeze. Slice in half, using a gentle sawing motion.

### S ushi

Sushi translated means vinegar rice. It can be simple or lavish, and variations are endless. Quality ingredients are essential and determine flavor, appearance, and texture. The use of umeboshi plums, paste, or pickles preserves freshness and delights with refreshing flavor.

The Wall Street Journal rated E DEN ’s Sushi Gift Basket “Best Overall” and said, “it had enough extra elements to provide hours of experimentation... the kit was impressive. Our rolls came out tight and attractive thanks to the sturdy mat and good color photo instructions.”

Sushi Facts Maki-sushi, Nori-maki, and Nori Roll are some names for vinegary rice rolled up in sheets of Nori sea vegetable with various cooked or raw fillings. Sushi requires a little initial practice, but it truly is easy. Here are some basic tips to get you rolling. Be creative. Variations are endless.

Seasoning the Rice Heat 2 tablespoons each of E DEN Organic Brown Rice Vinegar and E DEN Mirin. Pour evenly over cooked rice and gently fold into the freshly cooked rice with a rice paddle or wooden spatula. Do not over mix. Cool to room temperature before making sushi. Hot rice will cause the nori to break after becoming too moist.

Sushi Presentation Arrange sushi on a plate attractively garnished with a small pile of E DEN Pickled Ginger, wasabi pyramid, flowers, parsley sprigs, or cut vegetables. It’s customary to serve sushi with green tea. E DEN Sencha or E DEN Matcha powdered organic green tea are perfect.

Noodle Sushi E DEN Organic or Traditional Japanese Soba noodles make attractive sushi, in place of rice. Divide one package of soba evenly into four bundles and tie one end securely with 100% cotton string. Place the bundles in boiling water, gently combing through the noodles with a fork to prevent sticking. Cook per package directions. Rinse and drain. Lay one bundle of soba across the nori, with tied end exposed off the sheet. Slice off tied end and discard. Carefully spread the noodles out, leaving 1” at the bottom of the nori and 3” at the top uncovered. Add raw scallions, cooked spinach, or other fillings in a straight line across the width of the soba. Lightly moisten the top of the nori with fingers and roll in a jelly roll fashion like rice sushi. Slice roll into pieces with a moistened knife. Repeat until all soba has been rolled into sushi.
