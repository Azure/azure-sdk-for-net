## Welcome!

You can kiss those messy bamboo sushi mats goodbye. Instead, you are in for a surprise! Our SushiQuik Kit produces a perfectly round sushi roll every time---and it is a breeze to clean.

Think of sushi as a Japanese rolled sandwich. So easy. So delicious. You can use healthy ingredients. You can let your imagination run wild with possible fillings. Even kids love doing it.

Traditionally, Japanese sushi is made with ingredients from Japanese cuisine and culture. It is comprised of a series of small bites of fresh food wrapped in sushi rice that have been rolled together using a bamboo rolling mat.

SushiQuik sushi is made using our new (and we think easier to use) SushiQuik rolling mat---for sushi with a new twist---because in addition to using traditional Japanese ingredients, you can also now make it with absolutely anything you want.

### Fabulous traditional Japanese sushi recipes---plus some with a new twist!

What do we mean by a new twist?! Think Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Rolls. Reuben Rolls. Or Chicken Tenders Rolls.

Whether your tastes run from traditional to inventive, you’ll find inspiration here for creating perfect rolls.

In no time you will be pulling off your next sushi party or sushi dinner for your family and look like you have been practicing for days!

IMPORTANT: The Sushiquik components should be thoroughly washed prior to use for food preparation. All of the Sushiquik components are dishwasher safe. When washing in the dishwasher, place the SushiQuik components on the top rack of your dishwasher away from the heat element.

### How To Use Your SushiQuik Kit

(take a deep breath. smile. roll up your sleeves. start rolling!)

1.  Prepare your sushi ingredients and place them within easy reach of your preparation area.Tip:  See recipe for making the perfect sushi rice.

2.  Insert the round mat into either of the insertion slots in the black base. Remove the green caps from either end and roll out your mat.

3.  Place your nori sheet onto the white mat. Place the training frame on top of the nori sheet, making sure the open line under the word "TOP" is vacant and that the nori sheet is not showing through it. If the nori sheet is showing, bring it down a bit until the line is free.

4.  Evenly spread the sushi rice onto the nori sheet using the rice paddle or wet fingers. Be sure to use the height of the training frame walls to determine how much rice to place.

5.  Once the rice is evenly spread, remove the training frame. You should have a strip of the nori sheet which is rice free.

6.  Place your ingredients onto the rice, making sure not to use too much as itcan make it difficult to close the roll.Once your ingredients are placed onto the rice, you are ready to roll! 

7.  Bring the track closest to you over the roll onto the mat and tighten once with your fingers.

8.  Then lift the folded track and continue to roll until you reach the end of the nori sheet.

9.  Once you have completed the roll in the mat, tighten the track one more time with your fingers.Tip:  Make sure to tighten evenly along the roll from left to right.

10.  Remove the mat from the top of your roll.

11.  Place your roll under the roll cutter. Using a sharp knife, place the knife in each open area of the cutter to cut your roll into eight even pieces.Tip: Wet the surface of the knife blade. This will lubricate the blade to allow for easier slicing.

12.  When complete, remove the cutter from the roll, which is now evenly cut into eight pieces.

### Cooking Rice For All Rolls Made With SushiQuik: 

SUSHI RICE: What is it? Room temperature cooked rice flavored with a slightly sweet vinegar mixture. It is the building block of sushi, which will become your first thin layer on top of the seaweed nori sheet.

#### STEP ONE IS TO COOK THE RICE: 

*   You will need one cup of cooked rice per sushi roll. Choose Japanese sushi rice or short grain rice. (not long grain)

*   Before cooking it, make sure to swirl the rice around in a bowl of water four times and rinse until the water becomes clear, then let it rest drained in a colander for at least 30 minutes before cooking.

*   If cooking your rice in an electric rice cooker, follow the instructions.

*   If cooking on the top of the stove, place one cup of water and one cup of rice in        a pot, cover, and bring to a boil and boil for 4 minutes. Then reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, leave the cover on, and let the pot stand for 15 minutes.

#### STEP TWO IS TO TOSS THE RICE WITH YOUR VINEGAR SAUCE: 

##### Ingredients for one cup sushi rice:

1/4 cup rice wine vinegar

1/8 cup sugar (or less)

1/8 cup sake or mirin (if you do not have mirin or sake, use the following vinegar recipe)

8 tablespoons rice vinegar

3 tablespoons fine sugar

###### teaspoon salt

###### Method: 

*   Heat vinegar, sugar and salt gently until dissolved and cool to room temperature.

*   Gently mix the cooked rice and sauce in a glass or wooden bowl by sprinkling one tablespoon of vinegar sauce over one cup of rice and tossing them together until the rice is well coated. Taste for seasoning and add more vinegar sauce if desired.

*   Cover the rice with a warm damp kitchen towel to keep it moist until you are ready to use it.

###### STEP THREE IS TO SPREAD THE RICE ON THE NORI SHEET: 

Remember, when you spread the rice do not pack it down. Keep it light, yet evenly spread either with wet (clean!) fingers or with the SushiQuik non-stick paddle.

###### Notes: 

Mirin can also be used instead of sugar. It is a sweet Japanese wine that lends an aromatic flavor to the rice as well as a touch of sweetness. The sugar and mirin are interchangeable.

When you buy your seaweed nori, make sure to buy yaki-nori, which is precooked.

You can buy sushi vinegar (awasezu), which is formulated specifically for making sushi rice. Or you can use regular Japanese rice vinegar.

#### Dessert Sushi Rolls

(yes, sweet rolls!)

The only difference with dessert sushi rolls is that you will not be using seaweed nori sheets to make them. Surprise! You will be using delicious sheets made from fruit! We are introducing these dessert sheets from New Gem Foods which you can buy online at their web site: [New Gem Foods](http://www.newgemfoods.com/) 

Called Origami Wraps, they come in beautiful jewel like colors and are made from vegetables and fruit. Each of the following recipes uses one of their fruit based sheets.

##### The other difference is how you make your rice.

##### DESSERT SUSHI ROLL RICE: 

*   Prepare the rice the same way you would for regular sushi rolls, but cook the rice in coconut milk instead of water.

*   Instead of mixing the cooked rice with vinegar sauce, this time you will make a sauce of the following and toss the warm rice

with the sweet sauce to coat it well. Add the sauce slowly, using only enough to coat the rice evenly and to not get the rice too wet.

## Why Sushi Is Good For You

1.  Sushi is normally eaten fresh---right after it is made.

2.  Its main ingredient, rice, is both a protein and a carbohydrate. White rice is an excellent source of thiamin (vitamin B1), magnesium, iron, zinc, and niacin (vitamin B3). Brown rice has all of these vitamins in even greater quantity, plus it has more fiber.

3.  Rice vinegar is made from brown rice. Its health benefits are many. Because it is made from brown rice, it has a huge amount of amino acids; it helps prevent cholesterol; helps stop the formation of damaging free radicals; and it is a potent anti-bacterial. Vinegar, high in acetic acid, helps the body absorb all nutrients, making it a superb addition to almost anything you eat.

4.  Nori is a seaweed and seaweeds are famous for being loaded with minerals, vitamins, and iodine, as well having high levels of vitamins A and C. Iodine helps keep cholesterol down. Nori is fat free and low calorie. And nori contains Lignans, which have properties that help fight cancer.

5.  When you take all of the above and combine them with fresh vegetables and proteins, you have almost the perfect meal in a hand held package!
