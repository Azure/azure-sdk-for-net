# Azure.AI.Language.QuestionAnswering.Authoring Samples

Azure AI Language Question Answering Authoring is a capability of the Azure AI Language service that lets you create, manage, and deploy question answering projects in your Azure resource. It helps you build a knowledge base by extracting Q&A pairs from semi‑structured sources (FAQ pages, manuals, documents) and continually improves relevance using user interaction signals.
