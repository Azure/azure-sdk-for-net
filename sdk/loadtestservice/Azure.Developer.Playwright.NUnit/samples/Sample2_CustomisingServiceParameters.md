using System;

namespace PlaywrightService.SampleTests; // Remember to change this as per your project namespace

[SetUpFixture]
public class PlaywrightServiceNUnitSetup : PlaywrightServiceBrowserNUnit
{
    public PlaywrightServiceNUnitSetup() : base(
        credential: new ManagedIdentityCredential(),
        options: new PlaywrightServiceBrowserClientOptions()
        {
            UseCloudHostedBrowsers = true,
            OS = OSPlatform.Linux,
            ExposeNetwork = "<loopback>",
            RunId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
        }
