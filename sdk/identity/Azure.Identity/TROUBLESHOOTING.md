## Handle Azure Identity Exceptions

### AuthenticationFailedException
Exceptions arising from authentication errors can be raised on any service client method that makes a request to the service. This is because the token is requested from the credential on the first call to the service and on any subsequent requests to the service that need to refresh the token. 

To distinguish these failures from failures in the service client, Azure Identity classes raise the `AuthenticationFailedException` with details describing the source of the error in the exception message and possibly the error message. Depending on the application, these errors may or may not be recoverable.

``` c#
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets;

// Create a secret client using the DefaultAzureCredential
var client = new SecretClient(new Uri("https://myvault.vault.azure.net/"), new DefaultAzureCredential());

try
{
    KeyVaultSecret secret = await client.GetSecretAsync("secret1");
}
catch (AuthenticationFailedException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Authentication Failed. {e.Message}");
}
```
### CredentialUnavailableException

The `CredentialUnavailableExcpetion` is a special exception type derived from `AuthenticationFailedException`. This exception type is used to indicate that the credential can’t authenticate in the current environment, due to lack of required configuration or setup. This exception is also used as a signal to chained credential types, such as `DefaultAzureCredential` and `ChainedTokenCredential`, that the chained credential should continue to try other credential types later in the chain.

### Permission Issues

Calls to service clients resulting in `RequestFailedException` with a `StatusCode` of 401 or 403 often indicate the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions for the specified API. Check the service documentation to determine which RBAC roles are needed for the specific request, and ensure the authenticated user or service principal have been granted the appropriate roles on the resource.

## Find Relevant Information in Exception Messages

`AuthenticationFailedException` is thrown when unexpected errors occurred while a credential is authenticating. This can include errors received from requests to the AAD STS and often contains information helpful to diagnosis. Consider the following `AuthenticationFailedException` message.

![AuthenticationFailedException Message Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/images/AuthFailedErrorMessageExample.png)

This error contains several pieces of information:

- __Failing Credential Type__: The type of credential that failed to authenticate. This can be helpful when diagnosing issues with chained credential types such as `DefaultAzureCredential` or `ChainedTokenCredential`.

- __STS Error Code and Message__: The error code and message returned from the Azure AD STS. This can give insight into the specific reason the request failed. For instance, in this specific case because the provided client secret is incorrect. More information on STS error codes can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-aadsts-error-codes#aadsts-error-codes).

- __Correlation ID and Timestamp__: The correlation ID and call Timestamp used to identify the request in server-side logs. This information can be useful to support engineers when diagnosing unexpected STS failures.

### Enable and Configure Logging

The Azure Identity library provides the same [logging capabilities](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/core/Azure.Core/samples/Diagnostics.md#logging) as the rest of the Azure SDK.

The simplest way to see the logs to help debug authentication issues is to enable the console logger.

``` c#
// Setup a listener to monitor logged events.
using AzureEventSourceListener listener = AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger();
```

All credentials can be configured with diagnostic options, in the same way as other clients in the SDK.

``` c#
DefaultAzureCredentialOptions options = new DefaultAzureCredentialOptions()
{
    Diagnostics =
    {
        LoggedHeaderNames = { "x-ms-request-id" },
        LoggedQueryParameters = { "api-version" },
        IsLoggingContentEnabled = true
    }
};
```

> CAUTION: Requests and responses in the Azure Identity library contain sensitive information. Precaution must be taken to protect logs when customizing the output to avoid compromising account security.

## Troubleshoot `ManagedIdentityCredential` Authentication Issues

The `ManagedIdentityCredential` is designed to work on a variety of Azure hosts that provide managed identity. Configuring the managed identity and troubleshooting failures varies from hosts. The below table lists the Azure hosts that can be assigned a managed identity, and are supported by the `ManagedIdentityCredential`.

#### __Verify the Azure CLI can obtain tokens__
You can manually verify that the Azure CLI is properly authenticated, and can obtain tokens. First use the `account` command to verify the account which is currently logged in to the Azure CLI. 

```bash
az account show
```

Once you've verified the Azure CLI is using correct account, you can validate that it’s able to obtain tokens for this account.

```bash
az account get-access-token --output json --resource https://management.core.windows.net
```
>Note that output of this command will contain a valid access token, and SHOULD NOT BE SHARED to avoid compromising account security.
