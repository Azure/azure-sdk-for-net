# Release History

## 1.5.0-beta.2 (Unreleased)


## 1.5.0-beta.1 (2021-06-08)

### Fixes and improvements

- Added `LoginHint` property to `InteractiveBrowserCredentialOptions` which allows a user name to be pre-selected for interactive logins. Setting this option skips the account selection prompt and immediately attempts to login with the specified account.
- Added `AuthorizationCodeCredentialOptions` which allows for configuration of a ReplyUri.

## 1.4.0 (2021-05-12)

### New Features

- By default, the MSAL Public Client Client Capabilities are populated with "CP1" to enable support for [Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/app-resilience-continuous-access-evaluation).
This indicates to AAD that your application is CAE ready and can handle the CAE claim challenge. This capability can be disabled, if necessary, by either setting an `AppContext` switch named "Azure.Identity.DisableCP1" to `true` or by setting the environment variable;
"AZURE_IDENTITY_DISABLE_CP1" to "true". Note: AppContext switches can also be configured via configuration like below:
  
```xml  
<ItemGroup>
    <RuntimeHostConfigurationOption Include="Azure.Identity.DisableCP1" Value="true" />
</ItemGroup> 
  ```
### Fixes and improvements

- The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) dependency versions have been updated to the latest
    - Microsoft.Identity.Client version 4.30.1, Microsoft.Identity.Client.Extensions.Msal version 2.18.4.
