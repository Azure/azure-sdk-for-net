Azure AI Vision Face is a cloud service that  gives you access to advanced algorithms that process images and return information based on the visual features you're interested in.

- Detect faces from image [synchronously](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/face/Azure.AI.Vision.Face/tests/samples/Sample1_FaceDetection.cs) or [asynchronously](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/face/Azure.AI.Vision.Face/tests/samples/Sample1_FaceDetectionAsync.cs)
  - From local image file
  - From URL
- Verification and identification from Large Person Group [synchronously](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/face/Azure.AI.Vision.Face/tests/samples/Sample2_LargePersonGroup.cs) or [asynchronously](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/face/Azure.AI.Vision.Face/tests/samples/Sample2_LargePersonGroupAsync.cs)
- Detect liveness in faces with session [synchronously](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/face/Azure.AI.Vision.Face/tests/samples/Sample3_DetectLivenessWithSession.cs) or [asynchronously](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/face/Azure.AI.Vision.Face/tests/samples/Sample3_DetectLivenessWithSessionAsync.cs)
