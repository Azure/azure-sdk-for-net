# Azure Provisioning Kubernetes client library for .NET

Azure.Provisioning.Kubernetes simplifies declarative resource provisioning in .NET.

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the client library for .NET with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/ ):

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Provisioning.Kubernetes --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites

> You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).

### Authenticate the Client

## Key concepts

This library allows you to specify your infrastructure in a declarative style using dotnet.  You can then use azd to deploy your infrastructure to Azure directly without needing to write or maintain bicep or arm templates.

## Troubleshooting

-   File an issue via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues).
-   Check [previous questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure+.net) or ask new ones on Stack Overflow using Azure and .NET tags.
