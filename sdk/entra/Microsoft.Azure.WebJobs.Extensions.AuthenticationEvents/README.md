# Authentication events trigger for Azure Functions client library for .NET

The authentication events trigger for Azure Functions allows you to implement a custom extension to handle Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication events. The authentication events trigger handles all the backend processing for incoming HTTP requests for Azure AD authentication events and provides the developer with:

- Token validation for securing the API call
- Object model, typing, and IDE intellisense
- Inbound and outbound validation of the API request and response schemas

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the authentication events trigger for Azure Functions with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/):

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.AuthenticationEvents --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Subscription:** To use Azure services, including Azure Functions, you'll need a subscription. If you do not have an existing Azure account, you may sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) or use your [Visual Studio Subscription](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/) benefits when you [create an account](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index).

### Authenticate the client

When the Azure AD authentication events service calls your custom extension, it sends an `Authorization` header with a `Bearer {token}`. This token represents a [service to service authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow) in which:

* The '**resource**', also known as the **audience**, is the application that you register to represent your API. This is represented by the `aud` claim in the token.
* The '**client**' is a Microsoft application that represents the Azure AD authentication events service. It has an `appId` value of `99045fe1-7639-4a75-9d4a-577b6ca3810f`. This is represented by:
  * The `azp` claim in the token if your application `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property is set to `2`.
  * The `appid` claim in the token if your resource application's `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property is set to `1` or `null`.

There are three approaches to authenticating HTTP requests to your function app and validating the token. 

#### Validate tokens using Azure Functions Azure AD authentication integration

When running your function in production, it is **highly recommended** to use the [Azure Functions Azure AD authentication integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad#-option-2-use-an-existing-registration-created-separately) for validating incoming tokens. Set the following function [application settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings?tabs=portal#settings).

1. Go to the "Authentication" tab in your Function App
2. Click on "Add identity provider"
3. Select "Microsoft" as the identity provider
4. Select "Provide the details of an existing app registration"
5. Enter the `Application ID` of the app that represents your API in Azure AD

The issuer and allowed audience depends on the [`accessTokenAcceptedVersion`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) property of your application (can be found in the "Manifest" of the application).

If the `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property is set to `2`:
6. Set the `Issuer URL to "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/v2.0"
7. Set an 'Allowed Audience' to the Application ID (`appId`)

If the `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property is set to `1` or `null`:
6. Set the `Issuer URL to "https://sts.windows.net/{tenantId}/"
7. Set an 'Allowed Audience' to the Application ID URI (also known as`identifierUri`). It should be in the format of`api://{azureFunctionAppName}.azurewebsites.net/{resourceApiAppId}` or `api://{FunctionAppFullyQualifiedDomainName}/{resourceApiAppId}` if using a [custom domain name](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dns/dns-custom-domain#:~:text=Azure%20Function%20App%201%20Navigate%20to%20Function%20App,Custom%20domain%20text%20field%20and%20select%20Validate.%20).

By default, the Authentication event trigger will validate that Azure Function authentication integration is configured and it will check that the **client** in the token is set to `99045fe1-7639-4a75-9d4a-577b6ca3810f` (via the `azp` or `appid` claims in the token).

If you want to test your API against some other client that is not Azure AD authentication events service, like using Postman, you can configure an _optional_ application setting:

* **AuthenticationEvents__CustomCallerAppId** - the guid of your desired client. If not provided, `99045fe1-7639-4a75-9d4a-577b6ca3810f` is assumed.

#### Have the trigger validate the token

In local environments or environments that aren't hosted in the Azure Function service, the trigger can do the token validation. Set the following application settings in the [local.settings.json](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) file:

* **AuthenticationEvents__TenantId** - your tenant ID
* **AuthenticationEvents__AudienceAppId** - the same value as "Allowed audience" in option 1.
* **AuthenticationEvents__CustomCallerAppId** (_optional_) - the guid of your desired client. If not provided, `99045fe1-7639-4a75-9d4a-577b6ca3810f` is assumed.

An example `local.settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
    "AuthenticationEvents__TenantId": "8615397b-****-****-****-********06c8",
    "AuthenticationEvents__AudienceAppId": "api://46f98993-****-****-****-********0038",
    "AuthenticationEvents__CustomCallerAppId": "46f98993-****-****-****-********0038"
  }
}
```

#### No token validation

If you would like to _not_ authenticate the token while in local development, set the following application settings in the [local.settings.json](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) file:

* **AuthenticationEvents__BypassTokenValidation** - value of `true` will make the trigger not check for a validation of the token.

### Quickstart

* Visual Studio 2019
  * Start Visual Studio
  * Select "Create a new project"
  * In the template search area search and select "AzureAuthEventsTrigger"
  * Give your project a meaningful Project Name, Location, Solution and Solution Name.

* Visual Studio Code
  * Start Visual Studio Code
  * Run the command "Create Azure Authentication Events Trigger Project" via the command palette
  * Follow the project creation prompts
* Please note: that on a first time run it might take awhile to download the the required packages.
* For development purpose turn of token validation for testing:
* Add the **AuthenticationEvents__BypassTokenValidation** application key to the "Values" section in the local.settings.json file and set it's value to **true**. If you do not have a local.settings.json file in your local environment, create one in the root of your Function App.

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
    "AuthenticationEvents__BypassTokenValidation": true
  }
}
```

* Once the project is loaded, you can run the sample code and you should see the Azure functions developer's application load your end point.

## Key concepts

### .NET SDK

Key concepts of the Azure .NET SDK can be found [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html).

### Azure AD custom extensions

Custom extensions allow you to handle Azure AD events, integrate with external systems, and customize what happens in your application authentication experience. For example, a custom claims provider is a custom extension that allows you to enrich or customize application tokens with information from external systems that can't be stored as part of the Azure AD directory. 

### Authentication events trigger

The authentication events trigger allows a function to be executed when an authentication event is sent from the Azure AD event service.

### Authentication events trigger output binding

The authentication events trigger output binding allows a function to send authentication event actions to the Azure AD event service.

## Documentation

* One the function has been published, there's some good reading about logging and metrics that can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitor-log-analytics?tabs=csharp)

* For API Documentation, please see the (Link TBD)
* Once this moves to preview, we except no breaking changes and would be as simple as removing the the NuGet source that points to the private preview.

## Examples

To Test Token Augmentation, please do the following.

* Start Visual Studio.
* Open the project that was created in the prior step. (QuickStart)
* Run the Application. (F5)
* Once the Azure functions developer's application has started, copy the listening url that is displayed with the application starts up.
* Note: All Authentication functions are listed, in the case we have one function listener registered called "**OnTokenIssuanceStart**"
* Your function endpoint will then be a combination of the listening url and function, for example: "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/AuthenticationEvents?code=(YOUR_CODE)&function=OnTokenIssuanceStart"
* Post the following payload using something like Postman or Fiddler.
* Steps for using Postman can be found (Link TBD)

                        ]
                    }
             }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

* Visual Studio Code
  * If running in Visual Studio Code, you get an error along the lines of the local Azure Storage Emulator is unavailable, you can start the emulator manually.! (Note: Azure Storage emulator is now deprecated and the suggested replacement is [Azurite](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=visual-studio))
  * If using Visual Studio Code on Mac please use [Azurite](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=visual-studio)
  * If you see the following error on Windows (it's a bug) when trying to run the created projected.
  * This can be resolved by executing this command in powershell `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine` more info on this can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/issues/1821) and [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7)

## Next steps

For more information on Azure SDK, please refer to [this website](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/)

## Publish

* Follow the instruction here to create and publish your Azure Application. <https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs?tabs=in-process#publish-to-azure>
* To determine your published posting endpoint, combine the azure function endpoint you created, route to the listener and listener code, the listen code can be found by navigating to your azure function application, selecting "App Keys" and copying the value of AuthenticationEvents_extension.
* For example: "https://azureautheventstriggerdemo.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/AuthenticationEvents?code=(AuthenticationEvents_extension_key)&function=OnTokenIssuanceStart"
* Make sure your production environment has the correct application settings for token authentication.
* Once again you can test the published function by posting the above payload to the new endpoint.
