The default is 2 seconds(PT2S). Note that this setting is ignored if VideoSyncMode.Passthrough is set, where the KeyFrameInterval value will follow the input source setting. </param>

The value can be in ISO 8601 format (For example, PT05S for one image every 5 seconds), or a frame count (For example, 30 for one image every 30 frames), or a relative value to stream duration (For example, 10% for one image every 10% of stream duration). Note: Step value will affect the first generated thumbnail, which may not be exactly the one specified at transform preset start time. This is due to the encoder, which tries to select the best thumbnail between start time and Step position from start time as the first output. As the default value is 10%, it means if stream has long duration, the first generated thumbnail might be far away from the one specified at start time. Try to select reasonable value for Step if the first thumbnail is expected close to start time, or set Range value at 1 if only one thumbnail is needed at start time. </param>
        /// <param name="range"> The position relative to transform preset start time in the input video at which to stop generating thumbnails. The value can be in ISO 8601 format (For example, PT5M30S to stop at 5 minutes and 30 seconds from start time), or a frame count (For example, 300 to stop at the 300th frame from the frame at start time. If this value is 1, it means only producing one thumbnail at start time), or a relative value to the stream duration (For example, 50% to stop at half of stream duration from start time). The default value is 100%, which means to stop at the end of the stream. </param>
