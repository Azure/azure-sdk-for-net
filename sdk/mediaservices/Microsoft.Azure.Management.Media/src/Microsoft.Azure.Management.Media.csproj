            <![CDATA[
        This SDK is using 2020-05-01 version of the API
        
        * The Media Services account now supports system managed identities.
        * When a Media Services account has a managed identity, it can be used to enable encryption at REST with a customer managed key.
        * When a Media Services account has a managed identity, it can be used to access the attached storage accounts using the managed identity.

        * Live event added an Allocate action to put it into StandBy state.
        * Updates to most live event properties are now allowed when the live event is in stopped and standby state.
        * Users can specify a prefix for the static hostname for the live event's input and preview URLs.
        * VanityUrl is now called useStaticHostName to better reflect the intent of the property.
        * When an encoding live event receives input with aspect ratio different from the one specified in the preset, stretch mode allows customers to specify the stretching behavior for the output.
        * Encoding live events can now be configured to output constant fragment size of between 0.5 to 20 seconds.
        * Live transcription APIs allow customers to turn on live transcription for one of the many supported languages.

        * Added property Video.SyncMode which controls the frame rate of the encoded output.  Supported values are "Auto", "Passthrough", "Cfr", and "Vfr".
        * Added Property JpgImage.SpriteColumn, which can be used to set the number of columns used in thumbnail sprite image
        * Added CopyAllBitrateNonInterleaved Preset, which can be used to clip an existing asset or convert a group of key frame (GOP) aligned MP4 files as an asset that can be streamed.
        * Added UtcClipTime class, which specifies the clip time as a Utc time position in the media file during a job creation.
        * Added the “Mode” property to Audio/VideoAnalyzerPresets, exposing a new Basic Mode that only performs transcription and caption generation.

        Breaking changes:
        * VanityUrl property on LiveEvent is now called UseStaticHostName to better reflect the intent of the property.
        * SubscriptionMediaService class has been removed in favor of MediaService class. SubscriptionMediaService is a duplicate of MediaService class.
        * Basic and Standard live encoding types referred to the same live event type.  Basic LiveEventEncodingType has now been removed. Supported encoding types are Standard, Premium1080p or None.
