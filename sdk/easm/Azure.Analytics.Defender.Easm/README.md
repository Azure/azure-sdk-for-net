# Azure Easm client library for .NET

Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (Defender EASM)\* continuously discovers and maps your digital attack surface to provide an external view of your online infrastructure. This visibility enables security and IT teams to identify unknowns, prioritize risk, eliminate threats, and extend vulnerability and exposure control beyond the firewall. Defender EASM leverages Microsoft's crawling technology to discover assets that are related to your known online infrastructure, and actively scans these assets to discover new connections over time. Attack Surface Insights are generated by leveraging vulnerability and infrastructure data to showcase the key areas of concern for your organization.

## Getting started
### Install the package

First, provide instruction for obtaining and installing the package or library. This section might include only a single line of code, like `dotnet add package package-name`, but should enable a developer to successfully install the package from NuGet, npm, or even cloning a GitHub repository.

Install the client library for .NET with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/ ):

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Analytics.Defender.Easm --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites
> You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) and [EASM worskspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/external-attack-surface-management/deploying-the-defender-easm-azure-resource). In order to take advantage of the C# 8.0 syntax, it is recommended that you compile using the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 3.0 or higher with a [language version](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version#override-a-default) of `latest`.  It is also possible to compile with the .NET Core SDK 2.1.x using a language version of `preview`.

### Authenticate the client

The examples shown below use a [`DefaultAzureCredential`][DefaultAzureCredential], which is appropriate for most scenarios including local development and production environments utilizing managed identity authentication.

You can find more information on different ways of authenticating and their corresponding credential types in the [Azure Identity][azure_identity] documentation.

To use the `DefaultAzureCredential` provider shown below,
or other credential providers provided with the Azure SDK, you must first install the Azure.Identity package:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
```

To create an EasmClient, you need your subscription ID, region, and some sort of credential. Below is an example using the DefaultAzureCredential.

```C# Snippet:Sample1_Create_Client
string endpoint = "https://<region>.easm.defender.microsoft.com";
EasmClient client = new EasmClient(new System.Uri(endpoint),
                "<Your_Subscription_Id>",
                "<Your_Resource_Group_Name>",
                "<Your_Workspace_Name>",
                new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

## Key concepts

The *Key concepts* section should describe the functionality of the main classes. Point out the most important and useful classes in the package (with links to their reference pages) and explain how those classes work together. Feel free to use bulleted lists, tables, code blocks, or even diagrams for clarity.

Include the *Thread safety* and *Additional concepts* sections below at the end of your *Key concepts* section. You may remove or add links depending on what your library makes use of:

### Thread safety

We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples

You can familiarize yourself with different APIs using [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/easm/Azure.Analytics.Defender.Easm/samples).

### <scenario>

You can create a client and call the client's `<operation>` method.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Analytics_Defender_Easm_Scenario
Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
```

## Troubleshooting

Describe common errors and exceptions, how to "unpack" them if necessary, and include guidance for graceful handling and recovery.

Provide information to help developers avoid throttling or other service-enforced errors they might encounter. For example, provide guidance and examples for using retry or connection policies in the API.

If the package or a related package supports it, include tips for logging or enabling instrumentation to help them debug their code.

## Next steps

* Provide a link to additional code examples, ideally to those sitting alongside the README in the package's `/samples` directory.
* If appropriate, point users to other packages that might be useful.
* If you think there's a good chance that developers might stumble across your package in error (because they're searching for specific functionality and mistakenly think the package provides that functionality), point them to the packages they might be looking for.

## Contributing

This is a template, but your SDK readme should include details on how to contribute code to the repo/package.
