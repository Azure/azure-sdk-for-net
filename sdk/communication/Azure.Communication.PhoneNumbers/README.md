# Azure Communication Phone Numbers client library for .NET

Azure Communication Phone Numbers is managing phone numbers for Azure Communication Services.

[Source code][source] <!--| [Package (NuGet)][package]--> | [Product documentation][product_docs] | [Samples][source_samples]

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Communication Phone Numbers client library for .NET with [NuGet][nuget]:

```Powershell
dotnet add package Azure.Communication.PhoneNumbers --version 1.0.0-beta.6
```

### Prerequisites

You need an [Azure subscription][azure_sub] and a [Communication Service Resource][communication_resource_docs] to use this package.

To create a new Communication Service, you can use the [Azure Portal][communication_resource_create_portal], the [Azure PowerShell][communication_resource_create_power_shell], or the [.NET management client library][communication_resource_create_net].

<!--
Here's an example using the Azure CLI:

```Powershell
[To be ADDED]
```
-->

### Key concepts

Phone plans come in two types; Geographic and Toll-Free. Geographic phone plans are phone plans associated with a location, whose phone numbers' area codes are associated with the area code of a geographic location. Toll-Free phone plans are phone plans not associated location. For example, in the US, toll-free numbers can come with area codes such as 800 or 888.

All geographic phone plans within the same country are grouped into a phone plan group with a Geographic phone number type. All Toll-Free phone plans within the same country are grouped into a phone plan group.

### Authenticate the client

Phone Number clients can be authenticated using connection string acquired from an Azure Communication Resources in the [Azure Portal][azure_portal].

```C# Snippet:CreatePhoneNumbersClient
// Get a connection string to our Azure Communication resource.
var connectionString = "<connection_string>";
var client = new PhoneNumbersClient(connectionString);
```

Phone Number clients also have the option to authenticate with Azure Active Directory Authentication. With this option,
`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variables need to be set up for authentication.

```C# Snippet:CreatePhoneNumbersClientWithTokenCredential
// Get an endpoint to our Azure Communication resource.
var endpoint = new Uri("<endpoint_url>");
TokenCredential tokenCredential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
client = new PhoneNumbersClient(endpoint, tokenCredential);
```

### Phone number types overview
Phone numbers come in two types: Geographic and Toll-Free. Geographic phone plans are phone plans associated with a location, whose phone numbers' area codes are associated with the area code of a geographic location. Toll-Free phone plans are phone plans not associated location. For example, in the US, toll-free numbers can come with area codes such as 800 or 888.

### Searching, purchasing and releasing phone numbers

Phone numbers can be searched through the search creation API by providing an area code, quantity of phone numbers, application type, phone number type and capabilities. The provided quantity of phone numbers will be reserved for ten minutes and can be purchased within this time. If the search is not purchased, the phone numbers will become available to others after ten minutes. If the search is purchased, then the phone numbers are acquired for the Azure resources.

Phone numbers can also be released using the release API.

### Thread safety
We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples


## Creating a PhoneNumbersClient

To create a new `PhoneNumbersClient` you need a connection string to the Azure Communication Services resource that you can get from the Azure Portal once you have created the resource.

You can set `connectionString` based on an environment variable, a configuration setting, or any way that works for your application.

```C# Snippet:CreatePhoneNumbersClient
// Get a connection string to our Azure Communication resource.
var connectionString = "<connection_string>";
var client = new PhoneNumbersClient(connectionString);
```

## Search phone numbers

Phone numbers need to be searched before they can be purchased. Search is a long running operation that can be started by `StartSearchAvailablePhoneNumbers` function that returns an `SearchAvailablePhoneNumbersOperation` object. `SearchAvailablePhoneNumbersOperation` can be used to update status of the operation and to check for completeness.

```C# Snippet:SearchPhoneNumbersAsync
var capabilities = new PhoneNumberCapabilities(calling:PhoneNumberCapabilityType.None, sms:PhoneNumberCapabilityType.Outbound);

var searchOperation = await client.StartSearchAvailablePhoneNumbersAsync(countryCode, PhoneNumberType.TollFree, PhoneNumberAssignmentType.Application, capabilities);
await searchOperation.WaitForCompletionAsync();
```

## Purchase phone numbers

Phone numbers can be acquired through purchasing a search.

```C# Snippet:StartPurchaseSearchAsync
var purchaseOperation = await client.StartPurchasePhoneNumbersAsync(searchOperation.Value.SearchId);
await purchaseOperation.WaitForCompletionResponseAsync();
```

## Listing purchased phone numbers

You can list all phone numbers that have been purchased for your resource.

```C# Snippet:GetPurchasedPhoneNumbersAsync
var purchasedPhoneNumbers = client.GetPurchasedPhoneNumbersAsync();

await foreach (var phoneNumber in purchasedPhoneNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Phone number: {phoneNumber.PhoneNumber}, monthly cost: {phoneNumber.Cost}");
}
```

## Release phone numbers

If you no longer need a phone number you can release it.

```C# Snippet:ReleasePhoneNumbersAsync
var purchasedPhoneNumber = "<purchased_phone_number>";
var releaseOperation = await client.StartReleasePhoneNumberAsync(purchasedPhoneNumber);
await releaseOperation.WaitForCompletionResponseAsync();
```
