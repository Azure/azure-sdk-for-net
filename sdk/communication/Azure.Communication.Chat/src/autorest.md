# Azure.Communication.Chat
When a new version of the swagger needs to be updated:
1. Go to sdk\communication, and run `dotnet msbuild /t:GenerateCode` to generate code.
2. Upload the Azure.Communication.Chat.dll to the apiview.dev tool.
If any of the new objects needs to be overwritten, add the required changes to the 'Models' folder.

3. Repeat 2 and 3 until the desided interface is reflected in the apiview.dev
