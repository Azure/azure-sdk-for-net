## 1.2.0 (2022-09-01)

### Features Added

- Added `string RawID { get; }` and `static CommunicationIdentifier FromRawId(string rawId)` to `CommunicationIdentifier` to translate between a `CommunicationIdentifier` and its underlying canonical rawId representation. Developers can now use the rawId as an encoded format for identifiers to store in their databases or as stable keys in general.
- Always include `rawId` when serializing identifiers to wire format.

## 1.1.0 (2022-02-23)
- Optimization added: When the proactive refreshing is enabled and the token refresher fails to provide a token that's not about to expire soon, the subsequent refresh attempts will be scheduled for when the token reaches half of its remaining lifetime until a token with long enough validity (>10 minutes) is obtained.
