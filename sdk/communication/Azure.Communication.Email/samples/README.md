# Azure Communication Email SDK samples

Azure Communication Email is a client library that provides the functionality to send emails.
To get started you will need to have an Azure Subscription. Once you have this you can go into the Azure portal and create an Azure Communication Services resource, an Azure Communication Email resource with a domain. The page will give you necessary information to be able to use the sample codes here such as connections string, shared access key, etc.

This client library allows to do following operations:
 - Send an Email to one or more recipients
 - Specify optional paramters while sending Emails
 - Get the status of a sent email

 #### You can find samples for each of these functions below.
 - Send Email Messages [synchronously][sample_email] or [asynchronously][sample_email_async]
