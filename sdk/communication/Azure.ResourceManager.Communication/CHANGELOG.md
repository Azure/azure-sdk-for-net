#### Management Client Changes

Example: Create A Communication Service Instance:

Before upgrade:
```C#
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.ResourceManager.Communication;
using Azure.ResourceManager.Communication.Models;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

string subscriptionId = "_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_";
CommunicationManagementClient communicationServiceClient = new CommunicationManagementClient(subscriptionId, new InteractiveBrowserCredential());
var resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroupName";
var resourceName = "myResource";
var resource = new CommunicationServiceResource { Location = "Global", DataLocation = "UnitedStates" };
var operation = await communicationServiceClient.CommunicationService.StartCreateOrUpdateAsync(resourceGroupName, resourceName, resource);
await operation.WaitForCompletionAsync();
```

After upgrade:
```C#
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.ResourceManager.Resources;
using Azure.ResourceManager.Resources.Models;

ArmClient armClient = new ArmClient(new DefaultAzureCredential());
Subscription subscription = await armClient.GetDefaultSubscriptionAsync();
ResourceGroupCollection rgCollection = subscription.GetResourceGroups();
string rgName = "myRgName";
Location location = Location.WestUS2;
ResourceGroupCreateOrUpdateOperation lro = await rgCollection.CreateOrUpdateAsync(rgName, new ResourceGroupData(location));
ResourceGroup resourceGroup = lro.Value;
var collection = resourceGroup.GetCommunicationServices();
string communicationServiceName = "myCommunicationService";
CommunicationServiceData data = new CommunicationServiceData()
{
    Location = "global",
    DataLocation = "UnitedStates",
};
var communicationServiceLro = await collection.CreateOrUpdateAsync(communicationServiceName, data);
CommunicationService communicationService = communicationServiceLro.Value;
```
