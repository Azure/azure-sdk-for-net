# Azure.Communication.CallingServer

When a new version of the swagger needs to be updated:
1. Open Azure.Communication.sln and under sdk\communication, run `dotnet msbuild /t:GenerateCode` to generate code.

2. Upload the Azure.Communication.Call.dll to the [apiview.dev tool](https://apiview.dev/).
If any of the new objects needs to be overwritten, add the required changes to the 'Models' folder.

3. Repeat 2 and 3 until the desided interface is reflected in the apiview.dev.
