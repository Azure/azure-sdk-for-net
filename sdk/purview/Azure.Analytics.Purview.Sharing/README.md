# Azure Purview Share client library for .NET

Microsoft Purview Share is a fully managed cloud service.

**Please rely heavily on the [service's documentation][share_product_documentation] and our [protocol client docs][protocol_client_quickstart] to use this library**

[Source code][source_code] | [Package (NuGet)][client_nuget_package] | [Product documentation][share_product_documentation]

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Microsoft Purview Share client library for .NET with [NuGet][client_nuget_package]:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Analytics.Purview.Sharing --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites

- You must have an [Azure subscription][azure_subscription] and a [Purview resource][purview_resource] to use this package.

### Authenticate the client

#### Using Azure Active Directory

This example demonstrates using [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to authenticate via Azure Active Directory. However, any of the credentials offered by the [Azure.Identity][azure_identity] will be accepted.  See the [Azure.Identity][azure_identity] documentation for more information about other credentials.

Once you have chosen and configured your credential, you can create instances of the `SentSharesClient`.

```C# Snippet:SentSharesClientSample_CreateSentSharesClient
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var endPoint = "https://my-account-name.purview.azure.com/share";
var sentShareClient = new SentSharesClient(endPoint, credential);
```

```C# Snippet:ReceivedSharesClientSample_CreateReceivedSharesClient
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var endPoint = "https://my-account-name.purview.azure.com/share";
var receivedSharesClient = new ReceivedSharesClient(endPoint, credential);
```

## Key concepts

### Protocol Methods

Operations exposed by the Purview Share client library for .NET use *protocol methods* to expose the underlying REST operations. You can learn more about how to use Azure SDK clients which use protocol methods in our [documentation][protocol_client_quickstart].

### Thread safety

We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples

The following section shows you how to initialize and authenticate your client and share data.

                paths = new[]
               {
                    new

var sentShareClient = new SentSharesClient(endPoint, credential);

Operation operation = await sentShareClient.DeleteSentShareAsync(WaitUntil.Completed, "sentShareId");
```

## Troubleshooting

### Setting up console logging
The simplest way to see the logs is to enable the console logging.
To create an Azure SDK log listener that outputs messages to console use AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger method.

```C#
// Setup a listener to monitor logged events.
using AzureEventSourceListener listener = AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger();
```

To learn more about other logging mechanisms see [here][azure_core_diagnostics].
