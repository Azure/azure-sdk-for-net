# Azure Share client library for .NET

Microsoft Purview Share is a fully managed cloud service.

**Please rely heavily on the [service's documentation][share_product_documentation] and our [protocol client docs][protocol_client_quickstart] to use this library**

[Source code][source_code] | [Package (NuGet)][client_nuget_package] | [Product documentation][share_product_documentation]

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Microsoft Purview Share client library for .NET with [NuGet][client_nuget_package]:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Analytics.Purview.Share --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites

- You must have an [Azure subscription][azure_subscription] and a [Purview resource][purview_resource] to use this package.

### Authenticate the client

#### Using Azure Active Directory

This document demonstrates using [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to authenticate via Azure Active Directory. However, any of the credentials offered by the [Azure.Identity][azure_identity] will be accepted.  See the [Azure.Identity][azure_identity] documentation for more information about other credentials.

Once you have chosen and configured your credential, you can create instances of the `SentSharesClient`.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Analytics_Purview_Share_Authenticate_The_Client
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var endPoint = "https://<my-account-name>.purview.azure.com/share";
var sentShareClient = new SentSharesClient(endPoint, credential);
```

## Key concepts

### Protocol Methods

Operations exposed by the Purview Share SDK for .NET use *protocol methods* to expose the underlying REST operations. You can learn more about how to use SDK Clients which use protocol methods in our [documentation][protocol_client_quickstart].

### Thread safety

We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

var invitationData = new
{
    invitationKind = "User",
    properties = new
    {
        targetEmail = "user@domain.com"
    }
};

// Instead of sending invitation to Azure login email of the user, you can send invitation to object ID of a service principal and tenant ID.
// Tenant ID is optional. To use this method, comment out the previous declaration, and uncomment the next one.
//var invitationData = new
//{
//    invitationKind = "Application",
//    properties = new
//    {
//        targetActiveDirectoryId = "<targetActieDirectoryId>",
//        targetObjectId = "<targetObjectId>"

var receivedInvitation = receivedInvitations.LastOrDefault();

if (receivedInvitation == null)
{
    //No received invitations
    return;
}

var receivedInvitationDocument = JsonDocument.Parse(receivedInvitation).RootElement;
var receivedInvitationId = receivedInvitationDocument.GetProperty("name");

var receivedShareData = new
{
    shareKind = "InPlace",
    properties = new

    }
};

var assetMappingsClient = new AssetMappingsClient(endPoint, credential);
var assetMapping = await assetMappingsClient.CreateAsync(WaitUntil.Completed, receivedShareName, assetMappingName, RequestContent.Create(assetMappingData));
```

## Troubleshooting

### Setting up console logging
The simplest way to see the logs is to enable the console logging.
To create an Azure SDK log listener that outputs messages to console use AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger method.

```C#
// Setup a listener to monitor logged events.
using AzureEventSourceListener listener = AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger();
```

To learn more about other logging mechanisms see [here][azure_core_diagnostics].
