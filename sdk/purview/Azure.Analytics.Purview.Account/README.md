# Azure Purview Account client library for .NET

Azure Purview Account is a fully managed cloud service.

**Please rely heavily on the [service's documentation][account_product_documentation] and our [protocol client docs][protocol_client_quickstart] to use this library**

[Source code][source_code] | [Package (NuGet)][client_nuget_package] | [Product documentation][account_product_documentation]

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Purview Account client library for .NET with [NuGet][client_nuget_package]:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Analysis.Purview.Account --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites

- You must have an [Azure subscription][azure_subscription] and a [Purview resource][purview_resource] to use this package.

### Authenticate the client

#### Using Azure Active Directory

This document demonstrates using [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to authenticate via Azure Active Directory. However, any of the credentials offered by the [Azure.Identity][azure_identity] will be accepted.  See the [Azure.Identity][azure_identity] documentation for more information about other credentials.

Once you have chosen and configured your credential, you can create instances of the `AccountClient`.

```C#
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var client = new PurviewAccountClient(new Uri("https://<my-account-name>.purview.azure.com"), credential);
```

## Key concepts

### Protocol Methods

Operations exposed by the Purview Account SDK for .NET use *protocol methods* to expose the underlying REST operations. You can learn more about how to use SDK Clients which use protocol methods in our [documentation][protocol_client_quickstart].

### Thread safety

We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples

The following section shows you how to initialize and authenticate your client, then get all of the type definitions in the catalog.

### Get All Type Definitions

```C#
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var client = new PurviewAccountClient(new Uri("https://<my-account-name>.purview.azure.com"), credential);

var Response response = await client.GetAccountPropertiesAsync();
using var responseDocument = JsonDocument.Parse(response.Content);
Console.WriteLine(responseDocument.RootElement.GetProperty("name"));
```

## Troubleshooting

### Setting up console logging
The simplest way to see the logs is to enable the console logging.
To create an Azure SDK log listener that outputs messages to console use AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger method.

```C#
// Setup a listener to monitor logged events.
using AzureEventSourceListener listener = AzureEventSourceListener.CreateConsoleLogger();
```

To learn more about other logging mechanisms see [here][azure_core_diagnostics].

## Next steps

This client SDK exposes operations using *protocol methods*, you can learn more about how to use SDK Clients which use protocol methods in our [documentation][protocol_client_quickstart].
