# Guide for migrating to Azure.Messaging.EventHubs from Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs

This guide is intended to assist in the migration to version 5 of the Event Hubs client library from version 4.  It will focus on side-by-side comparisons for similar operations between the v5 packages, [`Azure.Messaging.EventHubs`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/) and [`Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor/)  and their v4 equivalents, [`Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs/) and [`Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor/).

Familiarity with the v4 client library is assumed.  For those new to the Event Hubs client library for .NET, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/README.md), [Event Hubs samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/samples), and the [Event Processor samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor/samples) for the v5 library rather than this guide.

## Migration benefits

A natural question to ask when considering whether or not to adopt a new version or library is what the benefits of doing so would be.  As Azure has matured and been embraced by a more diverse group of developers, we have been focused on learning the patterns and practices to best support developer productivity and to understand the gaps that the .NET client libraries have.

There were several areas of consistent feedback expressed across the Azure client library ecosystem.  One of the most important is that the client libraries for different Azure services have not had a consistent approach to organization, naming, and API structure.  Additionally, many developers have felt that the learning curve was difficult, and the APIs did not offer a good, approachable, and consistent onboarding story for those learning Azure or exploring a specific Azure service.

To try and improve the development experience across Azure services, including Event Hubs, a set of uniform [design guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html) was created for all languages to drive a consistent experience with established API patterns for all services.  A set of [.NET-specific guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html) was also introduced to ensure that .NET clients have a natural and idiomatic feel that mirrors that of the .NET base class libraries.  Further details are available in the guidelines for those interested.

For Event Hubs, the modern client library was designed to provide an approachable onboarding experience for those new to messaging and/or the Event Hubs service with the goal of enabling a quick initial feedback loop for publishing and consuming events.  A gradual step-up path follows, building on the onboarding experience and shifting from exploration to tackling real-world production scenarios.  Finally, a set of specialized clients are available for those developers with high-throughput or special needs and who are interested in working at a lower-level.  This version is under active development and will continue to receive enhancements and improvements on a regular cadence.

The modern Event Hubs client library also provides the ability to share in some of the cross-service improvements made to the Azure development experience, such as using the new `Azure.Identity` library to share a single authentication between clients and a unified diagnostics pipeline offering a common view of the activities across each of the client libraries. 

While we believe that there is significant benefit to adopting the modern version of the Event Hubs client library, it is important to be aware that the legacy version has not been officially deprecated.  It will continue to be supported with security and bug fixes as well as receiving some minor refinements.  However, in the near future it will not be under active development and new features are unlikely to be added.  There is no guarantee of feature parity between the modern and legacy client library versions.

## General changes

### Package and namespaces

Package names and the namespace root for the modern Azure client libraries for .NET have changed.  Each will follow the pattern `Azure.[Area].[Service]` where the legacy clients followed the pattern `Microsoft.Azure.[Service]`.  This provides a quick and accessible means to help understand, at a glance, whether you are using the modern or legacy clients.

In the case of Event Hubs, the modern client libraries have packages and namespaces that begin with `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs` and were released beginning with version 5.  The legacy client libraries have packages and namespaces that begin with `Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs` and a version of 4.x.x or below.

### Client hierarchy

The key goal for the modern Event Hubs client library was to provide a first-class experience for developers, from early exploration of Event Hubs through real-world use.  We wanted to simplify the API surface to focus on scenarios important to the majority of developers without losing support for those with specialized needs.  To achieve this, the client hierarchy has been split into two general categories, mainstream and specialized.  

The mainstream set of clients provides an approachable onboarding experience for those new to Event Hubs with a clear step-up path to production use.  The specialized set of clients is focused on high-throughput and allowing developers a higher degree of control, at the cost of more complexity in their use.  This section will briefly introduce the clients in both categories, with the remainder of the migration guide focused on mainstream scenarios.

#### Mainstream  

In order to allow for a single focus and clear responsibility, the core functionality for publishing and reading events belongs to two distinct clients, rather than the single `EventHubClient` used by previous versions.  The producer and consumer clients operate in the context of a specific Event Hub and offer operations for all partitions. Unlike in v4, the clients are not bound to a specific partition, but the methods on them have overloads to handle specific partitions if needed.

- The [EventHubProducerClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer?view=azure-dotnet) is responsible for publishing events and supports multiple approaches for selecting the partition to which the event is associated, including automatic routing by the Event Hubs service and specifying an explicit partition.
  
- The [EventHubConsumerClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.consumer.eventhubconsumerclient?view=azure-dotnet) supports reading events from a single partition and also offers an easy way to familiarize yourself with Event Hubs by reading from all partitions without the rigor and complexity that you would need in a production application. For reading events from all partitions in a production scenario, we strongly recommend using the [EventProcessorClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient?view=azure-dotnet) over the `EventHubConsumerClient`.

- The [EventProcessorClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient?view=azure-dotnet) is responsible for reading and processing events for all partitions of an Event Hub. It will collaborate with other instances for the same Event Hub and consumer group pairing to balance work between them.  A high degree of fault tolerance is built-in, allowing the processor to be resilient in the face of errors.  The `EventProcessorClient` can be found in the new [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor/) package which replaces the older [Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs.Processor/) package. 
  
  One of the key features of the `EventProcessorClient` is enabling tracking of which events have been processed by interacting with a durable storage provider.  This process is commonly referred to as [checkpointing](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-features#checkpointing) and the persisted state as a checkpoint.  This version of the `EventProcessorClient` only supports Azure Storage Blobs.  
  
  **_Important note on checkpoints:_**  The [EventProcessorClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient?view=azure-dotnet) does not support legacy checkpoint data created using the v4 `EventProcessorHost`.  In order to allow for a unified format for checkpoint data across languages, a more efficient approach to data storage, and improvements to the algorithm used for managing partition ownership, breaking changes were necessary.  An approach for migrating the v4 `EventProcessorHost` checkpoints can be found in the [migration samples](#migrating-event-processor-checkpoints) below.

#### Specialized

- The [PartitionReceiver](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.primitives.partitionreceiver?view=azure-dotnet) is responsible for reading events from a specific partition of an Event Hub, with a greater level of control over communication with the Event Hubs service than is offered by other event consumers.  More detail on the design and philosophy for the `PartitionReceiver` can be found in the [design document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/design/partition-receiver-proposal.md).

- The [EventProcessor<TPartition>](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.primitives.eventprocessor-1?view=azure-dotnet) provides a base for creating a custom processor for for reading and processing events for all partitions of an Event Hub. The `EventProcessor<TPartition>` fills a similar role as the EventProcessorClient, with cooperative load balancing and resiliency as its core features.  However, it also offers native batch processing, the ability to customize checkpoint storage, a greater level of control over communication with the Event Hubs service, and a less opinionated API.  The caveat is that this comes with additional complexity and exists as of an abstract base, which needs to be extended and the core “handler” activities implemented via override. 

  Generally speaking, the `EventProcessorClient` was designed to provide a familiar API to that of the `EventHubConsumerClient` and offer an intuitive "step-up" experience for developers exploring Event Hubs as they advance to production scenarios.  For a large portion of our library users, that covers their needs well.  There's definitely a point, however, where an application requires more control to handle higher throughput or unique needs - that's where the `EventProcessor<TPartition>` is intended to help.  More on the design and philosophy behind this can be found [design document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/design/event-processor%7BT%7D-proposal.md).

### Publish events

The v4 client allowed for sending a single event or an enumerable of events, which had the potential to fail unexpectedly if the maximum allowable size was exceeded. v5 aims to prevent this by asking that you first create a batch of events using `CreateBatchAsync` and then attempt to add events to that using `TryAdd()`. If the batch accepts an event, you can be confident that it will not violate size constraints when calling Send to publish the batch.

## Migration samples

### Migrating code from `PartitionSender` to `EventHubProducerClient` for publishing events to a partition

In v4, events could be published to a single partition using `PartitionSender`. You could also send a single event, a set of events, or a batch. In v5 only batches are supported to ensure that there are no unexpected exceptions generated during send; you can't put it in a batch if it was too large to send.

In v5, this has been consolidated into a more efficient SendAsync(EventDataBatch) method. Batching merges information from multiple events into a single publish message, reducing the amount of network communication needed vs publishing events one at a time. Events are published to a specific partition when partition id is set in [`CreateBatchOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.createbatchoptions?view=azure-dotnet) before calling [`CreateBatchAsync(CreateBatchOptions)`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient.createbatchasync?view=azure-dotnet#Azure_Messaging_EventHubs_Producer_EventHubProducerClient_CreateBatchAsync_Azure_Messaging_EventHubs_Producer_CreateBatchOptions_System_Threading_CancellationToken_).

The code below assumes all events fit into a single batch. For more complete example, see sample: [Publish events
to specific partition](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/samples/Sample06_PublishAnEventBatchToASpecificPartition.cs).

In v4:
```csharp
var connectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";

var connectionStringBuilder = new EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder(connectionString){ EntityPath = eventHubName }; 
var eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionStringBuilder.ToString());
var  partitionSender = eventHubClient.CreatePartitionSender("my-partition-id");

try
{
    EventDataBatch eventBatch = partitionSender.CreateBatch();
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("First")));
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Second")));

    await partitionSender.SendAsync(eventBatch);
}
finally
{
    await partitionSender.CloseAsync();
    await eventHubClient.CloseAsync();
}
```

In v5:
```csharp
var connectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";

await using (var producerClient = new EventHubProducerClient(connectionString, eventHubName))
{
    var batchOptions = new CreateBatchOptions() { PartitionId = "my-partition-id" };
    using EventDataBatch eventBatch = await producerClient.CreateBatchAsync(batchOptions);
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("First")));
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Second")));
    
    await producerClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
}
```

### Migrating code from `EventHubClient` to `EventHubProducerClient` for publishing events using automatic routing

In v4, events could be published to an Event Hub that allowed the service to automatically route events to an available partition.

In v5, automatic routing occurs when an [`EventDataBatch`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventdatabatch?view=azure-dotnet) is created using [`CreateBatchAsync()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient.createbatchasync?view=azure-dotnet#Azure_Messaging_EventHubs_Producer_EventHubProducerClient_CreateBatchAsync_System_Threading_CancellationToken_).

In v4:
```csharp
var connectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";

var connectionStringBuilder = new EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder(connectionString){ EntityPath = eventHubName }; 
var eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionStringBuilder.ToString());

try
{
    EventDataBatch eventBatch = eventHubClient.CreateBatch();
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("First")));
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Second")));

   await eventHubClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
}
finally
{
    await eventHubClient.CloseAsync();
}
```

In v5:
```csharp
var connectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";

await using (var producerClient = new EventHubProducerClient(connectionString, eventHubName))
{
    using EventDataBatch eventBatch = await producerClient.CreateBatchAsync();
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("First")));
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Second")));
    
    await producerClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
}
```

### Migrating code from `EventHubClient` to `EventHubProducerClient` for publishing events with partition key

In v4, events could be published with a partition key.

In v5, events are published with a partition key when partition key is set in [`CreateBatchOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.createbatchoptions?view=azure-dotnet) before calling [`CreateBatchAsync(CreateBatchOptions)`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient.createbatchasync?view=azure-dotnet#Azure_Messaging_EventHubs_Producer_EventHubProducerClient_CreateBatchAsync_Azure_Messaging_EventHubs_Producer_CreateBatchOptions_System_Threading_CancellationToken_).

In v4:
```csharp
var connectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";

var connectionStringBuilder = new EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder(connectionString){ EntityPath = eventHubName }; 
var eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionStringBuilder.ToString());

try
{
    EventData eventData = new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("First"));
    await eventHubClient.SendAsync(eventData, "my-partition-key");
}
finally
{
    await eventHubClient.CloseAsync();
}
```

In v5:
```csharp
var connectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";

await using (var producerClient = new EventHubProducerClient(connectionString, eventHubName))
{
    var batchOptions = new CreateBatchOptions() { PartitionKey = "my-partition-key" };
    using EventDataBatch eventBatch = await producerClient.CreateBatchAsync(batchOptions);
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("First")));
    eventBatch.TryAdd(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Second")));
    
    await producerClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
}
```

### Migrating code from `PartitionReceiver` to `EventHubConsumerClient` for reading events in batches

In v4, events were read by creating a `PartitionReceiver` and invoking `ReceiveAsync(int)` multiple times to read
events up to a certain number.

In v5, events can be streamed as they come in without having to use a batched read approach.

This code which reads from a partition in v4:
```csharp
var connectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";

var connectionStringBuilder = new EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder(connectionString){ EntityPath = eventHubName }; 
var eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionStringBuilder.ToString());
var partitionReceiver = client.CreateReceiver("my-consumer-group", "my-partition-id", EventPosition.FromStart());

try
{
    // Gets up to 100 events or until the read timeout elapses.
    IEnumerable<EventData> eventDatas = await partitionReceiver.ReceiveAsync(100);
    // Gets up to next 50 events or until the read timeout elapses.
    IEnumerable<EventData> eventDatas = await partitionReceiver.ReceiveAsync(50);
}
finally
{
    await partitionReceiver.CloseAsync();
    await eventHubClient.CloseAsync();
}
```

Becomes this in v5:
```csharp
var connectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";

string consumerGroup = EventHubConsumerClient.DefaultConsumerGroupName;

await using (var consumer = new EventHubConsumerClient(consumerGroup, connectionString, eventHubName))
{
    EventPosition startingPosition = EventPosition.Earliest;
    string partitionId = (await consumer.GetPartitionIdsAsync()).First();

    using var cancellationSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
    cancellationSource.CancelAfter(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(45));

    await foreach (PartitionEvent receivedEvent in consumer.ReadEventsFromPartitionAsync(partitionId, startingPosition, cancellationSource.Token))
    {
        // At this point, the loop will wait for events to be available in the partition.  When an event
        // is available, the loop will iterate with the event that was read.  Because we did not
        // specify a maximum wait time, the loop will wait forever unless cancellation is requested using
        // the cancellation token.
    }
}
```

See [`ReadEvents.cs`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/samples/Sample09_ReadEventsFromAKnownPosition.cs) for a sample program demonstrating this.

### Migrating code from `EventProcessorHost` to `EventProcessorClient` for reading events

In v4, `EventProcessorHost` allowed you to balance the load between multiple instances of your program and checkpoint
events when receiving. Developers would have to create and register a concrete implementation of `IEventProcessor` to
begin consuming events.

In v5, `EventProcessorClient` allows you to do the same, the development model is made simpler by using events. Rather than implementing an interface, you subscribe to the events that you are interested in by registering an event handler delegate, following the standard .NET pattern. To use this, include [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor) as a dependency.

The following code in v4:
```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args) 
{
    var storageConnectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE STORAGE ACCOUNT >>";
    var blobContainerName = "<< NAME OF THE BLOBS CONTAINER >>";
    var eventHubsConnectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
    var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";
    var consumerGroup = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB CONSUMER GROUP >>";
    var eventProcessorHost = new EventProcessorHost(eventHubName, consumerGroup, eventHubsConnectionString, storageConnectionString, blobContainerName);
    
    // Registers the Event Processor Host and starts receiving messages
    await eventProcessorHost.RegisterEventProcessorAsync<SimpleEventProcessor>();
    
    // When you are finished processing events.
    await eventProcessorHost.UnregisterEventProcessorAsync();
}

public class SimpleEventProcessor : IEventProcessor 
{
    public Task CloseAsync(PartitionContext context, CloseReason reason)
    {
         Console.WriteLine($"Processor Shutting Down. Partition '{context.PartitionId}', Reason: '{reason}'.");
         return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
    
    public Task OpenAsync(PartitionContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"SimpleEventProcessor initialized. Partition: '{context.PartitionId}'");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
    
    public Task ProcessErrorAsync(PartitionContext context, Exception error)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error on Partition: {context.PartitionId}, Error: {error.Message}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
    
    public Task ProcessEventsAsync(PartitionContext context, IEnumerable<EventData> messages)
    {
        foreach (var eventData in messages)
        {
            var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventData.Body.Array, eventData.Body.Offset, eventData.Body.Count);
            Console.WriteLine($"Event received. Partition: '{context.PartitionId}', Data: '{data}', Partition Key: '{eventData.SystemProperties.PartitionKey}'");
        }

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

In v5, in order to use the `EventProcessorClient`, handlers for event processing and errors must be provided.  These handlers are considered self-contained and developers are responsible for ensuring that exceptions within the handler code are accounted for.

```csharp
private async Task ProcessUntilCanceled(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var storageConnectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE STORAGE ACCOUNT >>";
    var blobContainerName = "<< NAME OF THE BLOBS CONTAINER >>";
    var eventHubsConnectionString = "<< CONNECTION STRING FOR THE EVENT HUBS NAMESPACE >>";
    var eventHubName = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB >>";
    var consumerGroup = "<< NAME OF THE EVENT HUB CONSUMER GROUP >>";

    async Task processEventHandler(ProcessEventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Event Received: { Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventArgs.Data.Body.ToArray()) }");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    async Task processErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error on Partition: {eventArgs.PartitionId}, Error: {eventArgs.Exception.Message}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    var storageClient = new BlobContainerClient(storageConnectionString, blobContainerName);
    var processor = new EventProcessorClient(storageClient, consumerGroup, eventHubsConnectionString, eventHubName);

### Migrating Event Processor checkpoints

In v4, the `EventProcessorHost` supported a model of pluggable storage providers for checkpoint data, using Azure Storage Blobs as the default.  Using the Azure Storage checkpoint manager, the lease and checkpoint information is stored as a JSON blob appearing within the Azure Storage account provided to the `EventProcessorHost`.  More details can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-event-processor-host#partition-ownership-tracking).

In v5, the `EventProcessorClient` is an opinionated implementation, storing checkpoints in Azure Storage Blobs, using the blob metadata to track information.  Unfortunately, the `EventProcessorClient` is unable to consume legacy checkpoints due to the differences in format, approach, and the possibility of a custom checkpoint provider having been used.

For v5, the `EventProcessorClient` will use a default starting position to read a partition when no checkpoint was found.  This default position may be set in the [`PartitionInitializingAsync`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclient.partitioninitializingasync?view=azure-dotnet) event.  One common approach for migrating legacy checkpoints is to read the legacy checkpoint data and use it to set the default starting position for the associated partition.  This example demonstrates that approach.

Because the nature of legacy checkpoint data cannot be assumed due to custom storage provider support, the example uses a static set of checkpoint data for illustration.  The format of this sample data matches that used by the default Azure Storage checkpoint manager of the `EventProcessorHost` for the body of the Blob holding checkpoint data.  

Reading Azure Storage data is not within the scope of this example, but details may be found in the Azure Storage documentation, see: [Quickstart: Azure Blob storage client library v12 for .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet).

    // if so, will apply it as a default for the partition so that the processor begins at the
