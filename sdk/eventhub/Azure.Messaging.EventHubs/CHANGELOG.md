Version 5.0.0-preview.1 is a preview of our efforts in creating a client library that is developer-friendly, idiomatic to the .NET ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages and platforms as possible.  The principles that guide our efforts can be found in the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for .NET](https://azuresdkspecs.z5.web.core.windows.net/DotNetSpec.html).
