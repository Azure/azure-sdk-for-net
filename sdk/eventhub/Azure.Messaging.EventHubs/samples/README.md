# Azure.Messaging.EventHubs Samples

The  Azure Event Hubs samples are intended to serve as an example and introduction to common scenarios in which the Event Hubs client library is used, and to help demonstrate library features.  The samples are accompanied by a [console application](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/samples/Program.cs) which you can use to execute and debug them interactively.  The simplest way to begin is to launch the project for debugging in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE and provide the Event Hubs connection information in response to the prompts.

Each of the samples is self-contained and focused on illustrating one specific scenario.  Each is numbered, with the lower numbers concentrating on basic scenarios and building to more complex scenarios as they increase; though each sample is independent, it will assume an understanding of the content discussed in earlier samples.

## Getting started

- **Azure Subscription:**  To use Azure services, including Azure Event Hubs, you'll need a subscription.  If you do not have an existing Azure account, you may sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) or use your [Visual Studio Subscription](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/) benefits when you [create an account](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index).

- **Event Hubs namespace with an Event Hub:** To interact with Azure Event Hubs, you'll also need to have a namespace and Event Hub available.  If you are not familiar with creating Azure resources, you may wish to follow the step-by-step guide for [creating an Event Hub using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create).  There, you can also find detailed instructions for using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to create an Event Hub.

- **C# 8.0:** The Azure Event Hubs client library makes use of new features that were introduced in C# 8.0.  You can still use the library with older versions of C#, but will need to manage asynchronous enumerable and asynchronous disposable members manually rather than benefiting from the C# 8.0 syntax improvements.  

  In order to take advantage of the C# 8.0 syntax, you will need the the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed and your application will need to either [target .NET Core 3.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/frameworks#how-to-specify-target-frameworks) or [specify a language version](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version#override-a-default) of 8.0 or higher.  Visual Studio users wishing to take advantage of the C# 8.0 syntax will need to use Visual Studio 2019 or later.  Visual Studio 2019, including the free Community edition, can be downloaded [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).

  **Important Note:** In order to build or run the the [samples](#available-samples) without modification, use of C# 8.0 is mandatory.  You can still run the samples if you decide to tweak them for other language versions.

To quickly create the needed Event Hubs resources in Azure and to receive a connection string for them, you can deploy our sample template by clicking:

If you'd like to run samples that use [Azure.Identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity), you'll also need a service principal with the correct roles. To make configuration for the identity samples easier, a [PowerShell script](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/assets/identity-samples-azure-setup.ps1) script is available. Please see the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/CONTRIBUTING.md#Azure-Identity-Samples) for more details about the script.
