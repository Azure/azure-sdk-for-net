# Azure.Messaging.EventHubs Samples

The Azure Event Hubs client library offers samples in two forms. Common application scenarios are presented as markdown documents, providing a detailed explanation of context while also demonstrating implementation details with snippets of code.  More specialized scenarios are presented as stand-alone projects to both illustrate the deeper end-to-end context and allow exploring interactively.  

The markdown-based samples are ordered by increasing complexity, starting with more basic scenarios to help get started quickly.  Though each sample is independent, they will assume an understanding of the content discussed in earlier samples.

Each of the application samples are intended to be self-contained and focused on illustrating one specific scenario.  The simplest way to begin is to launch the project for debugging in Visual Studio, or your preferred IDE, and provide the Event Hubs connection information in response to the prompts.  Each of these sample applications is accompanied by a dedicated README, offering more specific detail about its hosting needs and operation. 

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Subscription:**  To use Azure services, including Azure Event Hubs, you'll need a subscription.  If you do not have an existing Azure account, you may sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) or use your [Visual Studio Subscription](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/) benefits when you [create an account](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index).

- **Event Hubs namespace with an Event Hub:** To interact with Azure Event Hubs, you'll also need to have a namespace and Event Hub available.  If you are not familiar with creating Azure resources, you may wish to follow the step-by-step guide for [creating an Event Hub using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create).  There, you can also find detailed instructions for using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to create an Event Hub.

- **C# 8.0:** The Azure Event Hubs client library makes use of new features that were introduced in C# 8.0.  In order to take advantage of the C# 8.0 syntax, it is recommended that you compile using the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 3.0 or higher with a [language version](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version#override-a-default) of `latest`.  It is also possible to compile with the .NET Core SDK 2.1.x using a language version of `preview`.   

  Visual Studio users wishing to take full advantage of the C# 8.0 syntax will need to use Visual Studio 2019 or later.  Visual Studio 2019, including the free Community edition, can be downloaded [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).  Users of Visual Studio 2017 can take advantage of the C# 8 syntax by making use of the [Microsoft.Net.Compilers NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Net.Compilers/) and setting the language version, though the editing experience may not be ideal.

  You can still use the library with previous C# language versions, but will need to manage asynchronous enumerable and asynchronous disposable members manually rather than benefiting from the new syntax.  You may still target any framework version supported by your .NET Core SDK, including earlier versions of .NET Core or the .NET framework.  For more information, see: [how to specify target frameworks](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/frameworks#how-to-specify-target-frameworks).  

To quickly create a basic set of Event Hubs resources in Azure and to receive a connection string for them, you can deploy our sample template by clicking:

### Install the package

Install the Azure Event Hubs client library for .NET with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/):

```PowerShell
dotnet add package Azure.Messaging.EventHubs
```

### Authenticate the client

For the Event Hubs client library to interact with an Event Hub, it will need to understand how to connect and authorize with it.  The easiest means for doing so is to use a connection string, which is created automatically when creating an Event Hubs namespace.  If you aren't familiar with using connection strings with Event Hubs, you may wish to follow the step-by-step guide to [get an Event Hubs connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string).
