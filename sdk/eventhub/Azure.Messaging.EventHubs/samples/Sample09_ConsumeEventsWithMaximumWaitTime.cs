            // An Event Hub consumer is associated with a specific Event Hub partition and a consumer group.  The consumer group is
            // a label that identifies one or more consumers as a set.  Often, consumer groups are named after the responsibility
            // of the consumer in an application, such as "Telemetry" or "OrderProcessing".  When an Event Hub is created, a default
            // consumer group is created with it, called "$Default."

            // Each consumer has a unique view of the events in the partition, meaning that events are available to all consumers
            // and are not removed from the partition when a consumer reads them.  This allows for different consumers to read and
            // process events from the partition at different speeds and beginning with different events without interfering with
            // one another.
            //
            // When events are published, they will continue to exist in the partition and be available for consuming until they
            // reach an age where they are older than the retention period.

            // Because events are not removed from the partition when consuming, a consumer must specify where in the partition it
            // would like to begin reading events.  For example, this may be starting from the very beginning of the stream, at an
            // offset from the beginning, the next event available after a specific point in time, or at a specific event.

                    // because it opens its connection only when it needs to.  The first receive that we ask of it will not see
                    // any events, but will allow the consumer to start watching the partition.
