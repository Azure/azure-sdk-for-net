                // Each event that the initial consumer reads will have attributes set that describe the event's place in the
                // partition, such as its offset, sequence number, and the date/time that it was enqueued.  These attributes can be
                // used to create a new consumer that begins consuming at a known position.

                // With Event Hubs, it is the responsibility of an application consuming events to keep track of those that it has processed,

                // state, commonly known as "creating a checkpoint."
                //
                // The goal is to preserve the position of an event in some form of durable state, such as writing it to a database, so that if the
                // consuming application crashes or is otherwise restarted, it can retrieve that checkpoint information and use it to create a consumer that
                // begins reading at the position where it left off.
                //
                // It is important to note that there is potential for a consumer to process an event and be unable to preserve the checkpoint.  A well-designed
                // consumer must be able to deal with processing the same event multiple times without it causing data corruption or otherwise creating issues.
                // Event Hubs, like most event streaming systems, guarantees "at least once" delivery; even in cases where the consumer does not experience a restart,
                // there is a small possibility that the service will return an event multiple times.
                //
                // In this example, we will publish a batch of events to be received with an initial consumer.  The third event that is consumed will be captured
                // and another consumer will use its attributes to start reading the event that follows, consuming the same set of events that our initial consumer
