            // In this example, our consumer will read from the latest position instead of the earliest.  As a result, it won't see events that
            // have previously been published.  Before we can publish the events and have them observed, we will need to ask the consumer
            // to perform a read operation in order for it to begin observing the Event Hub partitions.
            //
            // Each partition of an Event Hub represents potentially infinite stream of events.  When a consumer is reading, there is no definitive
            // point where it can assess that all events have been read and no more will be available.  As a result, when the consumer reaches the end of
            // the available events for a partition, it will continue to wait for new events to arrive so that it can surface them to be processed. During this
            // time, the iterator will block.
            //
            // In order to prevent the consumer from waiting forever for events, and blocking other code, there are two methods available for developers to
            // control this behavior.  First, signaling the cancellation token passed when reading will cause the consumer to stop waiting and end iteration
            // immediately.  This is desirable when you have decided that you are done reading and do not wish to continue.  It is not ideal, however, when
            // you would like control returned to your code momentarily to perform some action and then to continue reading.
            //
            // In that scenario, you may specify a maximum wait time which is applied to each iteration of the enumerator.  If that interval passes without an
            // event being available to read, the enumerator will emit an empty event in order to return control to the loop body.  This allows you to take action,
            // such as sending a heartbeat, emitting telemetry, or simply exiting the loop.
            //
            // For our loop, we'll specify a small wait time when we begin reading, which will allow control to return to our code so that we may publish
