# Azure Event Hubs Checkpoint Store client library for .NET using Storage Blobs

WORDS NEEDED...

[Source code](.) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.CheckpointStore.Blob/) | [API reference documentation](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-net/api/EventHubs/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.CheckpointStore.Blob.html) | [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Microsoft Azure Subscription:**  To use Azure services, including Azure Event Hubs, you'll need a subscription.  If you do not have an existing Azure account, you may sign up for a free trial or use your MSDN subscriber benefits when you [create an account](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index). 

- **Event Hubs namespace with an Event Hub:** To interact with Azure Event Hubs, you'll also need to have a namespace and Event Hub  available.  If you are not familiar with creating Azure resources, you may wish to follow the step-by-step guide for [creating an Event Hub using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create).  There, you can also find detailed instructions for using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to create an Event Hub.

- **Azure Storage account with Blob Storage:** WORDS WORDS

To quickly create the needed Event Hubs resources in Azure and to receive a connection string for them, you can deploy our sample template by clicking:

### Install the package

Install the Azure Event Hubs client library for .NET with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/):

```PowerShell
Install-Package Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.CheckpointStore.Blob -Version 1.0.0-preview.1
```

### Obtain a connection string

For the Event Hubs client library to interact with an Event Hub, it will need to understand how to connect and authorize with it.  The easiest means for doing so is to use a connection string, which is created automatically when creating an Event Hubs namespace.  If you aren't familiar with shared access policies in Azure, you may wish to follow the step-by-step guide to [get an Event Hubs connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string).

### Create an Event Processor

Once the Event Hub and connection string are available, they can be used to create an event processor for interacting with Azure Event Hubs.  The simplest way to create an `EventProcessor` is:

```csharp
// CODE GOES HERE
```

## Key concepts

- An **Event processor** WORDS, WORDS, WORDS

- A **Partition manager** WORDS, WORDS, WORDS

- A **Checkpoint** WORDS, WORDS, WORDS

- A **partition** is an ordered sequence of events that is held in an Event Hub. Partitions are a means of data organization associated with the parallelism required by event consumers.  Azure Event Hubs provides message streaming through a partitioned consumer pattern in which each consumer only reads a specific subset, or partition, of the message stream. As newer events arrive, they are added to the end of this sequence. The number of partitions is specified at the time an Event Hub is created and cannot be changed.

- A **consumer group** is a view of an entire Event Hub. Consumer groups enable multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream, and to read the stream independently at their own pace and from their own position.  There can be at most 5 concurrent readers on a partition per consumer group; however it is recommended that there is only one active consumer for a given partition and consumer group pairing. Each active reader receives all of the events from its partition; if there are multiple readers on the same partition, then they will receive duplicate events.

## Examples

### Some Example

WORDS NEEDED.

```csharp

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common exceptions

#### Operation Canceled

This occurs when an operation has been requested on a client, producer, or consumer that has already been closed or disposed of.  It is recommended to check the application code and ensure that objects from the Event Hubs client library are created and closed/disposed in the intended scope.  

#### Timeout

This indicates that the Event Hubs service did not respond to an operation within the expected amount of time.  This may have been caused by a transient network issue or service problem.  The Event Hubs service may or may not have successfully completed the request; the status is not known.  It is recommended to attempt to verify the current state and retry if necessary.  

#### Message Size Exceeded

Event data, both individual and in batches, have a maximum size allowed.  This includes the data of the event, as well as any associated metadata and system overhead.  The best approach for resolving this error is to reduce the number of events being sent in a batch or the size of data included in the message.  Because size limits are subject to change, please refer to [Azure Event Hubs quotas and limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-quotas) for specifics.  

### Other exceptions

For detailed information about these and other exceptions that may occur, please refer to [Event Hubs messaging exceptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-messaging-exceptions). 

## Next steps

Beyond the scenarios discussed, the Azure Event Hubs blob storage checkpoint library offers support for additional scenarios to help take advantage of the full feature set of the Event Processor.  In order to help explore some of these scenarios, the Azure Event Hubs blob storage checkpoint library offers a [project of samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.CheckpointStore.Blob/samples) to serve as an illustration for common scenarios.

The samples are accompanied by a console application which you can use to execute and debug them interactively.  The simplest way to begin is to launch the project for debugging in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE and provide the Event Hubs connection information in response to the prompts.  

Each of the samples is self-contained and focused on illustrating one specific scenario.  Each is numbered, with the lower numbers concentrating on basic scenarios and building to more complex scenarios as they increase; though each sample is independent, it will assume an understanding of the content discussed in earlier samples.

The available samples are:

  An introduction to processing events using the Event Processor, illustrating how to configure the processor and connect to the Event Hubs service.
