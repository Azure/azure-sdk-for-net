# Azure Event Hubs Checkpoint Store for Azure Storage blobs client library for .NET

Intended as a companion to the `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs` client library, the Azure Event Hubs Checkpoint Store for Azure Storage Blobs enables using an Azure Storage account as the durable persistence mechanism for an `EventProcessor`.  The constructs in this library plug into the `EventProcessor` allowing it to preserve its state, in the form of checkpoints, as Azure storage blobs.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Microsoft Azure Subscription:**  To use Azure services, including Azure Event Hubs, you'll need a subscription.  If you do not have an existing Azure account, you may sign up for a free trial or use your MSDN subscriber benefits when you [create an account](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index). 

- **Event Hubs namespace with an Event Hub:** To interact with Azure Event Hubs, you'll also need to have a namespace and Event Hub available.  If you are not familiar with creating Azure resources, you may wish to follow the step-by-step guide for [creating an Event Hub using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create).  There, you can also find detailed instructions for using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to create an Event Hub.

- **Azure Storage account with blob storage:** To persist checkpoints as blobs in Azure Storage, you'll need to have an Azure Storage account with blobs available.  If you are not familiar with Azure Storage accounts, you may wish to follow the step-by-step guide for [creating a storage account using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&tabs=azure-portal).  There, you can also find detailed instructions for using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to create storage accounts.

To quickly create the needed resources in Azure and to receive connection strings for them, you can deploy our sample template by clicking:

### Install the package

Install the Azure Event Hubs Checkpoint Store for Azure Storage blobs client library for .NET using [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/):

```PowerShell
Install-Package Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.CheckpointStore.Blob -Version 1.0.0-preview.1
```

### Obtain an Event Hubs connection string

For the event processor to interact with an Event Hub, it will need to understand how to connect and authorize with it.  The easiest means for doing so is to use a connection string, which is created automatically when creating an Event Hubs namespace.  If you aren't familiar with shared access policies in Azure, you may wish to follow the step-by-step guide to [get an Event Hubs connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string).

### Obtain an Azure Storage connection string

For checkpoint storage to make use of Azure Storage blobs, it will need to understand how to connect to a storage account and authorize with it.  The most straightforward method of doing so is to use a connection string, which is generated at the time that the storage account is created.  If you aren't familiar with storage accounts in Azure, you may wish to follow the step-by-step guide to [configure Azure Storage connection strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string).

### Create an Event Processor that persists checkpoints in Azure Storage blobs

Once the Azure resources and connection strings are available, they can be used to create an event processor for interacting with Azure Event Hubs which persists its state via checkpoints in Azure Storage blobs.  The simplest way to create an `EventProcessor` that uses the `**TODO: CHECKPOINT BLOB NAME THING HERE**` is:

```csharp
// CODE GOES HERE
```

## Key concepts

- An **event processor** is a construct intended to manage the responsibilities associated with connecting to a given Event Hub and processing events from each of its partitions, in the context of a specific consumer group.  The act of processing events read from the partition and handling any errors that occur is delegated by the event processor to code that you provide, allowing your logic to concentrate on delivering business value while the processor handles the tasks associated with reading events, managing the partitions, and allowing state to be persisted in the form of checkpoints. 

- **Checkpointing** is a process by which readers mark and persist their position for events that have been processed for a partition. Checkpointing is the responsibility of the consumer and occurs on a per-partition, typically in the context of a specific consumer group.  For the `EventProcessor`, this means that for consumer group and partition combination, the processor must keep track of its current position in the event stream.  

  When an event processor connects, it will begin reading events at the checkpoint that was previously submitted by the last processor of that partition in that consumer group, if one exists.  As an event processor reads and acts on events in the partition, it should periodically create checkpoints to both mark the events as "complete" by downstream applications and to provide resiliency should an event processor or the environment hosting it fail.  Should it be necessary, it is possible to reprocess events that were previously marked as "complete" by specifying an earlier offset through this checkpointing process.

- A **partition** is an ordered sequence of events that is held in an Event Hub. Partitions are a means of data organization associated with the parallelism required by event consumers.  Azure Event Hubs provides message streaming through a partitioned consumer pattern in which each consumer only reads a specific subset, or partition, of the message stream. As newer events arrive, they are added to the end of this sequence. The number of partitions is specified at the time an Event Hub is created and cannot be changed.

- A **consumer group** is a view of an entire Event Hub. Consumer groups enable multiple consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream, and to read the stream independently at their own pace and from their own position.  There can be at most 5 concurrent readers on a partition per consumer group; however it is recommended that there is only one active consumer for a given partition and consumer group pairing. Each active reader receives all of the events from its partition; if there are multiple readers on the same partition, then they will receive duplicate events.

## Examples

### Some Example

WORDS NEEDED.

```csharp
// CODE HERE
```
## Troubleshooting

### Common exceptions

#### Timeout

This indicates that the Event Hubs service did not respond to an operation within the expected amount of time.  This may have been caused by a transient network issue or service problem.  The Event Hubs service may or may not have successfully completed the request; the status is not known.  It is recommended to attempt to verify the current state and retry if necessary.

### Other exceptions

For detailed information about these and other exceptions that may occur, please refer to [Event Hubs messaging exceptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-messaging-exceptions). 

## Next steps

Beyond the scenarios discussed, the Azure Event Hubs checkpoint store for Azure Storage blobs offers support for additional scenarios to help take advantage of the full feature set of the `EventProcessor`.  In order to help explore some of these scenarios, the library offers a [project of samples](./samples) to serve as an illustration for common scenarios.

The samples are accompanied by a console application which you can use to execute and debug them interactively.  The simplest way to begin is to launch the project for debugging in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE and provide the Event Hubs connection information in response to the prompts.  

Each of the samples is self-contained and focused on illustrating one specific scenario.  Each is numbered, with the lower numbers concentrating on basic scenarios and building to more complex scenarios as they increase; though each sample is independent, it will assume an understanding of the content discussed in earlier samples.

The available samples are:
