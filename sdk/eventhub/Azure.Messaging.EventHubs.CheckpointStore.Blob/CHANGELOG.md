Version 1.0.0-preview.1 is a preview of our efforts in creating a checkpoint store library that is developer-friendly, idiomatic to the .NET ecosystem, and as consistent across different languages and platforms as possible.  The principles that guide our efforts can be found in the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for .NET](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html).
