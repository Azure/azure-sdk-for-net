 * The following sample can be used if the environment you are targeting supports a different version of Storage Blobs SDK than those
 * typically available on Azure. For example, if you are running Event Hubs on an Azure Stack Hub version 2002, the highest available
 * version for the Storage service is version 2017-11-09. In this case, you will need to use the following code to change the Storage
 * service API version to 2017-11-09. For more information on the Azure Storage service versions supported on Azure Stack Hub, please
 * refer to <see href="http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-acs-differences"/>.

            // For instance, this will happen when you try to run the Event Processor Client on an Azure Stack Hub version 2002.  The

            // In order to do this, create a Blob Client Options instance and add a Storage Api Version Policy to it.  These options
