# Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor Samples

The samples are accompanied by a console application which you can use to execute and debug them interactively.  The simplest way to begin is to launch the project for debugging in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE and provide the Event Hubs connection information in response to the prompts.

Each of the samples is self-contained and focused on illustrating one specific scenario.  Each is numbered, with the lower numbers concentrating on basic scenarios and building to more complex scenarios as they increase; though each sample is independent, it will assume an understanding of the content discussed in earlier samples.

- [Hello world](./Sample01_HelloWorld.cs)
  An introduction to processing events using the Event Processor, illustrating how to configure the processor and connect to the Event Hubs service.
