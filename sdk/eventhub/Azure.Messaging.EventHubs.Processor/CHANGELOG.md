# Release History

## 5.4.0-beta.1 (2021-03-09)

### Changes

#### Key Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where long-lived credentials (more than 49 days) were overflowing refresh timer limits and being rejected.

- Added detection and recovery for a race condition that occurred when the Event Hubs service closed a connection or link after the client had validated its state and was performing an operation; this will now be properly retried with a fresh connection/link.

- Extended retry scenarios to include generic I/O exceptions, as they are typically transient network failures.

- Extended retry scenarios to include authorization failures, as the Event Hubs services do not differentiate between authentication and authorization, callers cannot reason about whether an `Unauthorized` return from an operation indicates that the call will never succeed or may trigger a credential renewal that may allow success.

## 5.3.0 (2021-02-09)

### Changes

#### New Features

- Additional options for tuning load balancing have been added to the `EventProcessorClientOptions`.

- It is now possible to specify a custom endpoint to use for establishing the connection to the Event Hubs service in the `EventHubConnectionOptions` for the processor.

- Interactions with Blob Storage have been tuned for better performance and more efficient resource use.  This will also improve start-up time, especially when using the `Greedy` load balancing strategy.

- Errors occurring in the Event Hubs service or active transport are now preserved in full and propagated as an inner exception; this will provide deeper context for diagnosing and troubleshooting exceptions.

- Documentation used for auto-completion via Intellisense and other tools has been enhanced in many areas, addressing gaps and commonly asked questions.

#### Key Bug Fixes

- Upgraded the `Microsoft.Azure.Amqp` library to resolve crashes occurring in .NET 5.

- The calculation for authorization token expiration has been fixed, resulting in fewer token refreshes and network requests.

## 5.3.0-beta.4 (2020-11-10)

### Changes

#### New Features

- Additional options for tuning load balancing have been added to the `EventProcessorClientOptions`.

- Documentation used for auto-completion via Intellisense and other tools has been enhanced in many areas, addressing gaps and commonly asked questions.

#### Key Bug Fixes

- Upgraded the `Microsoft.Azure.Amqp` library to resolve crashes occurring in .NET 5.

- The calculation for authorization token expiration has been fixed, resulting in fewer token refreshes and network requests.

## 5.3.0-beta.3 (2020-09-30)

### Changes

#### Key Bug Fixes

- An issue with package publishing which blocked referencing and use has been fixed.

## 5.3.0-beta.2 (2020-09-28)

### Changes

#### New Features

- The `EventData` representation has been extended with the ability to treat the `Body` as `BinaryData`.  `BinaryData` supports a variety of data transformations and allows the ability to provide serialization logic when sending or receiving events.  Any type that derives from `ObjectSerializer`, such as `JsonObjectSerializer` can be used, with Schema Registry support available via the `SchemaRegistryAvroObjectSerializer`.

- `EventData` has been integrated with the new Schema Registry service, via use of the `ObjectSerializer` with `BinaryData`.

**Note:** Azure Schema Registry is a new hosted schema repository service provided by Azure Event Hubs, and may not yet be available in all regions or Azure clouds.

## 5.3.0-beta.1 (2020-09-15)

### Changes

#### New Features

- Introduction of an option for the various event consumers allowing the prefetch cache to be filled based on a size-based heuristic rather than a count of events.  This feature is considered a special case, helpful in scenarios where the size of events being read is not able to be known or predicted upfront and limiting resource use is valued over consistent and predictable performance.

### Changes

#### Key Bug Fixes

- The approach used for creation of checkpoints has been updated to interact with Azure Blob storage more efficiently.  This will yield major performance improvements when soft delete was enabled and minor improvements otherwise.

- The `EventProcessorClient` will now perform an eager validation of connection strings upon creation.  Previously, validation was deferred until a partition was claimed which made debugging difficult.

- Fixed an issue where failure to create an AMQP link would lead to an AMQP session not being explicitly closed, causing connections to the Event Hubs service to remain open until a garbage collection pass was performed.

#### New Features

- Load balancing will now detect when it has reached a balanced state more accurately; this will allow it to operate more efficiently when `LoadBalancingStrategy.Greedy` is in use.

- The `EventProcessorClient` now supports a configurable strategy for load balancing, allowing control over whether it claims ownership of partitions in a balanced manner _(default)_ or more aggressively.  The strategy may be set in the `EventProcessorClientOptions` when creating the processor.  More details about strategies can be found in the associated [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.processor.loadbalancingstrategy?view=azure-dotnet).

- The `EventProcessorClientOptions` now support setting a `PrefetchCount` and `CacheEventCount` for performance tuning.  More details about each can be found in the associated [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventprocessorclientoptions?view=azure-dotnet).

- Connection strings for each of the clients now supports a `SharedAccessSignature` token, allowing a pre-generated SAS to be used for authorization.

- Load balancing now has better recognition for being in a recovery state and will aggressively reclaim partitions for which it is the recognized owner, regardless of whether the current instance made the ownership claim.  Previously, those partitions were redistributed on a 1-by-1 basis as part of the standard cycle. 

## 5.2.0-preview.3 (2020-08-18)

### Fixed
- Bug in TaskExtensions.EnsureCompleted method that causes it to unconditionally throw an exception in the environments with synchronization context

## 5.2.0-preview.2 (2020-08-10)

- A cleanup sweep was performed to tune small areas to be more efficient and perform fewer allocations.

## 5.1.0 

### Changes

#### General availability of preview features

- The set of features from v5.1.0-preview.1 are now generally available.  This includes the `EventProcessor<TPartition>` and `PartitionReceiver` types which focus on advanced application scenarios which require greater low-level control. 

#### Bug fixes and foundation

- Minor enhancements to reduce allocations and improve efficiency

## 5.1.0-preview.1 

### Acknowledgments

Thank you to our developer community members who helped to make the Event Hubs client libraries better with their contributions to this release:

- Christopher Scott _([GitHub](https://github.com/christothes))_
- Roman Marusyk _([GitHub](https://github.com/marusyk))_

#### Consuming events

- The `EventProcessorClient` has been enhanced to derive from the new `EventProcessor<TPartition>` primitive, bringing improvements to stability, resilience, and performance.

#### Publishing events

- Event batches are now protected against modification while publishing is actively taking place.

#### Bug fixes and foundation

- Validation for the Event Hubs fully qualified namespace has been improved, allowing for more deterministic failures when creating clients.

- Exceptions surfaced will now properly remember their context in all scenarios; previously, some deferred cases unintentionally reset the context.

- Logging for the Storage Manager for Azure Blobs now follows the common pattern for other Event Hubs types, as well as providing additional context and information.

- The diagnostic scope for activities will now complete in a more deterministic manner.  (A community contribution, courtesy of [christothes](https://github.com/christothes))

- Diagnostic activities have been extended with additional information about events being processed and with additional environmental context.

- Parsing of connection strings is now more permissive for the `Endpoint` key, allowing additional formats that result from common mistakes when building the string rather than copying the value from the portal.

- The partition manager has been renamed to `StorageManager` to better represent its purpose.  (A community contribution, courtesy of [marusyk](https://github.com/marusyk))

#### Testing

- The tests for load balancing and the Event Processor client have been tuned to remove dependencies on Azure resources and run more efficiently.  (A community contribution, courtesy of [christothes](https://github.com/christothes))

## 5.0.1 

Thank you to our developer community members who helped to make the Event Hubs client libraries better with their contributions to this release:

- Christopher Scott _([GitHub](https://github.com/christothes))_

### Changes

#### General

- A migration guide is now available for those moving from the 4.x version of the `Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs` libraries to the 5.0.1 version under the `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs` namespace.

#### Organization and naming

- Namespaces have been reorganized to align types to their functional area, reducing the number of types in the root namespace and offering better context for where a type is used.  Cross-functional types have been left in the root while specialized types were moved to the `Producer`, `Consumer`, or `Processor` namespaces.

#### Event processing

- Load balancing has been tuned for better performance and lower resource use.  (A community contribution, courtesy of [christothes](https://github.com/christothes))

- Reduction of reliance on Azure resources for Event Processor tests.  (A community contribution, courtesy of [christothes](https://github.com/christothes))

- Logging has been implemented for Event Processor operations interacting with storage. (A community contribution, courtesy of [christothes](https://github.com/christothes))

- Logging has been implemented for general Event Processing operations, including background execution.

- A bug with resuming from a storage checkpoint was fixed, ensuring that processing resumes from the next available event rather than reprocessing the event from which the checkpoint was created.

- The protected `On[EventName]` members have been marked private to reduce the public surface and reduce confusion.  They provided no benefit over providing a handler and the cognative cost was not justified.

## 5.0.0-preview.6 

### Acknowledgments

Thank you to our developer community members who helped to make the Event Hubs client libraries better with their contributions to this release:

- Christopher Scott _([GitHub](https://github.com/christothes))_

### Changes

#### Organization and naming

- This version is a reorganization of the Event Hubs client library packages, moving the `EventProcessorClient` into its own package and evolving this version into an opinionated implementation on top of Azure Storage Blobs.  This is intended to offer a more streamlined developer experience for the majority of scenarios and allow developers to more easily take advantage of the processor.

- A large portion of the public API surface, including members and parameters, have had adjustments to their naming in order to improve discoverability, provide better context to developers, and better conform to the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for .NET](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html).

#### Event processing

- The API for the `EventProcessorClient` has been revised, adopting an event-driven model that aligns to many of the .NET base class library types and reduces complexity when constructing the client.

- The handlers for event processing will now process events on an individual basis, allowing developers to control whether or not they wish to handle events as they're available or batch events before processing.

- The mechanism for creating checkpoints has been bundled with the event dispatched for processing; this allows a checkpoint to be created with a clear association with a given event, removing the need for developers to explicitly pass an event to a dedicated checkpoint manager.

#### Storage operations

- The concept of a plug-in model for the durable storage used by the processor has been removed; this package has taken a strong dependency on Azure Storage Blobs and no longer requires developers to manipulate an abstraction on top of storage.

- Checkpoints are now ensuring case-insensitivity for metadata to guard against inadvertent creation of multiple checkpoints for the same Event Hub / Consumer Group / Partition combination due to mixed casing.

#### General

- Removed the concept of explicitly closing or disposing the processor; the lifespan of resources is now managed implicitly within the scope of starting and stopping the processor.

- Synchronous members have been added for starting and stopping the event processor.
