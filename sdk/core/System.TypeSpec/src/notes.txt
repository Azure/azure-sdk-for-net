Architecture:

Allow efficient custom policies per request, i..e pipleline in options
Allow UTF8 implementations
Enable HTTP/2, maybe 3
Freeze options
Can we make some policies be read-only, i.e. prevent them from mutating the message

Change IPipelinePolicy to class, but this means all existing policies need to inherit from it.

Solve buffering problem
Make options configurable
Add expando properties to messages

Make policies public
Measure perfromance and allocation
Verify that LROs can be added
Verify that pageables can be added
Allow rotating client and process-wide cancellation tokens
Model serialization

Can we support custom pipelines?
Allow System.IO.Pipelines
What about:
- ETag, conditions, etc.
- dynamic
- response classifier
