            //
            // 1. If the content is buffered, we want it to remain available to the
            // client for model deserialization and in case the end user of the
            // client calls Result.GetRawResponse. So, we don't dispose it.
            //
            // If the content is buffered, we assume that the entity that did the
            // buffering took responsibility for disposing the network stream.
            //
            // 2. If the content is not buffered, we dispose it so that we don't leave
            // a network connection open.
            //
            // One tricky piece here is that in some cases, we may not have buffered
            // the content because we  wanted to pass the live network stream out of
            // the client method and back to the end-user caller of the client e.g.
            // for a streaming API.  If the latter is the case, the client should have
            // called the HttpMessage.ExtractResponseContent method to obtain a reference
            // to the network stream, and the response content was replaced by a stream
            // that we are ok to dispose here.  In this case, the network stream is
            // not disposed, because the entity that replaced the response content
            // intentionally left the network stream undisposed.
