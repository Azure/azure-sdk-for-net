## Read and write persistable models

Client library authors can implement the `IPersistableModel<T>` or `IJsonModel<T>` interfaces on strongly-typed model implementations.  If they do, end-users of service clients can then read and write those models in cases where they need to persist them to a backing store.

The example below shows how to write a persistable model to `BinaryData`.

```C# Snippet:Readme_Write_Simple
InputModel model = new InputModel();
BinaryData data = ModelReaderWriter.Write(model);
```

The example below shows how to read JSON to create a strongly-typed model instance.

```C# Snippet:Readme_Read_Simple
string json = @"{
      ""x"": 1,
      ""y"": 2,
      ""z"": 3
    }";
OutputModel? model = ModelReaderWriter.Read<OutputModel>(BinaryData.FromString(json));
```
