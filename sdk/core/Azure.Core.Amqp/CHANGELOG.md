### Acknowledgments

- Daniel Marbach  _([GitHub](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

### Features Added
- Added `ToBytes` and `FromBytes` methods to `AmqpAnnotatedMessage` to allow for serialization and deserialization of the message.

### Breaking Changes

- The nullability annotations were updated for the following properties of `AmqpAnnotatedMessage` to allow null values to be set in the dictionary, to comply with the [AMQP specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#section-message-format):
  - `ApplicationProperties`
  - `DeliveryAnnotations`
  - `MessageAnnotations`
  - `Footer`

### Other Changes

- Make `AmqpAddress` and `AmqpMessageId` readonly structs. _(A community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

## 1.2.0 (2021-07-06)

### Added
- All section properties of the `AmqpAnnotatedMessage` are now lazily allocated to reflect that they are defined as optional in the AMQP specification, section 3.2.
