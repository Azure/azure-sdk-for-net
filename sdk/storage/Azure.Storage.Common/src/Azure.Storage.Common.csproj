    .shproj Shared Code Projects aren't supported outside of VS/Windows, so
    we're hacking around that by manually sharing a couple folders of code.

    The Common project is the most sensible place for shared code to live.
    Unfortunately that shared code isn't used by the common project (and
    will actually break if you include it) so we're explicitly excluding it
    here.
