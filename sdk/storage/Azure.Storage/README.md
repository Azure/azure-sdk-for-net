# Azure Storage meta-package client library for .NET

[Source code][source] | [Package (NuGet)][package] | [API reference documentation][docs] | [REST API documentation][rest_docs] | [Product documentation][product_docs]

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Storage meta-package for .NET with [NuGet][nuget]:

```Powershell
dotnet add package Azure.Storage
```

### Prerequisites

You need an [Azure subscription][azure_sub] and a
[Storage Account][storage_account_docs] to use this package.

To create a new Storage Account, you can use the [Azure Portal][storage_account_create_portal],
[Azure PowerShell][storage_account_create_ps], or the [Azure CLI][storage_account_create_cli].
Here's an example using the Azure CLI:

```Powershell
az storage account create --name MyStorageAccount --resource-group MyResourceGroup --location westus --sku Standard_LRS
```

## Key concepts

The meta-package is designed to be a simple wrapper around the other storage libraries to enable folks that aren't interested in the
set of storage packages and just want to get started with basic storage operations to get up and running. Initially it will only
reference the Blobs library but we will adjust as more common scenarios emerge.
