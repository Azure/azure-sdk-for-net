### Support for binary data, custom shapes and Base64 encoding
This release adds a convinient way to send and receive binary data and custom shapes as a payload.
Additionally, support for Base64 encoding in HTTP requests and reponses has been added that makes interoperability with V11 and prior Storage SDK easier to implement.

The `QueueClient.SendMessage` and `QueueClient.SendMessageAsync` consume `System.BinaryData` in addition to `string`.
`QueueMessage` and `PeekedMessage` expose new property `Body` of `System.BinaryData` type to access message payload and should be used instead of `MessageText`.

See [System.BinaryData](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/System.Memory.Data_1.0.0/sdk/core/System.Memory.Data/README.md) for more information about handling `string`, binary data and custom shapes.

#### Receiving message as string
Before:
```C#
QueueMessage message = await queueClient.ReceiveMessage();
string messageText = message.MessageText;
```

After:
```C#
QueueMessage message = await queueClient.ReceiveMessage();
BinaryData body = message.Body;
string messageText = body.ToString();
```
