# Azure Cognitive Search client library for .NET

[Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/) is a
search-as-a-service cloud solution that gives developers APIs and tools
for adding a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content
in web, mobile, and enterprise applications.

The Azure Cognitive Search service is well suited for the following
 application scenarios:

* Consolidate varied content types into a single searchable index.
  To populate an index, you can push JSON documents that contain your content,
  or if your data is already in Azure, create an indexer to pull in data
  automatically.
* Attach skillsets to an indexer to create searchable content from images
  and large text documents. A skillset leverages AI from Cognitive Services
  for built-in OCR, entity recognition, key phrase extraction, language
  detection, text translation, and sentiment analysis. You can also add
  custom skills to integrate external processing of your content during
  data ingestion.
* In a search client application, implement query logic and user experiences
  similar to commercial web search engines.

Use the Azure.Search.Documents client library to:

* Submit queries for simple and advanced query forms that include fuzzy
  search, wildcard search, regular expressions.
* Implement filtered queries for faceted navigation, geospatial search,
  or to narrow results based on filter criteria.
* Create and manage search indexes.
* Upload and update documents in the search index.
* Create and manage indexers that pull data from Azure into an index.
* Create and manage skillsets that add AI enrichment to data ingestion.
* Create and manage analyzers for advanced text analysis or multi-lingual content.
* Optimize results through scoring profiles to factor in business logic or freshness.

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the Azure Cognitive Search client library for .NET with [NuGet][nuget]:

```Powershell
dotnet add package Azure.Search.Documents --version 11.2.0-beta.1
```

### Prerequisites

You need an [Azure subscription][azure_sub] and a
[search service][create_search_service_docs] to use this package.

To create a new search service, you can use the [Azure portal][create_search_service_docs],
[Azure PowerShell][create_search_service_ps], or the [Azure CLI][create_search_service_cli].
Here's an example using the Azure CLI to create a free instance for getting started:

```Powershell
az search service create --name <mysearch> --resource-group <mysearch-rg> --sku free --location westus
```

See [choosing a pricing tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-sku-tier)
 for more information about available options.

### Authenticate the client

All requests to a search service need an api-key that was generated specifically
for your service. [The api-key is the sole mechanism for authenticating access to
your search service endpoint.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-security-api-keys)
You can obtain your api-key from the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or via the Azure CLI:

```Powershell
az search admin-key show --service-name <mysearch> --resource-group <mysearch-rg>
```

There are two types of keys used to access your search service: **admin**
*(read-write)* and **query** *(read-only)* keys.  Restricting access and
operations in client apps is essential to safeguarding the search assets on your
service.  Always use a query key rather than an admin key for any query
originating from a client app.

*Note: The example Azure CLI snippet above retrieves an admin key so it's easier
to get started exploring APIs, but it should be managed carefully.*

We can use the api-key to create a new `SearchClient`.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_Authenticate
string indexName = "nycjobs";

// Get the service endpoint and API key from the environment
Uri endpoint = new Uri(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SEARCH_ENDPOINT"));
string key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SEARCH_API_KEY");

// Create a client
AzureKeyCredential credential = new AzureKeyCredential(key);
SearchClient client = new SearchClient(endpoint, indexName, credential);
```
### ASP.NET Core
To inject `SearchClient` as a dependency in an ASP.NET Core app, first install the package `Microsoft.Extensions.Azure`. Then register the client in the `Startup.ConfigureServices` method:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAzureClients(builder =>
    {
        builder.AddSearchClient(Configuration.GetSection("SearchClient"));
    });
  
    services.AddControllers();
}
```
To use the preceding code, add this to your configuration:

```json
{
    "SearchClient": {
      "endpoint": "https://<resource-name>.search.windows.net",
      "indexname": "nycjobs"
    }
}
```
You'll also need to provide your resource key to authenticate the client, but you shouldn't be putting that information in the configuration. Instead, when in development, use [User-Secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=windows#how-the-secret-manager-tool-works). Add the following to `secrets.json`:

```json
{
    "SearchClient": {
      "credential": { "key": "<you resource key>" }
    }
}
```
When running in production, it's preferable to use [environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=windows#environment-variables):

```
SEARCH__CREDENTIAL__KEY="..."
```
Or use other secure ways of storing secrets like [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/key-vault-configuration?view=aspnetcore-5.0).

For more details about Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core apps, see [Dependency injection with the Azure SDK for .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/sdk/dependency-injection).

## Key concepts

An Azure Cognitive Search service contains one or more indexes that provide
persistent storage of searchable data in the form of JSON documents.  _(If
you're brand new to search, you can make a very rough analogy between
indexes and database tables.)_  The Azure.Search.Documents client library
exposes operations on these resources through three main client types.

* `SearchClient` helps with:
  * [Searching](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-lucene-query-architecture)
    your indexed documents using
    [rich queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-query-overview)
    and [powerful data shaping](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-filters)
  * [Autocompleting](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/autocomplete)
    partially typed search terms based on documents in the index
  * [Suggesting](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/suggestions)
    the most likely matching text in documents as a user types
  * [Adding, Updating or Deleting Documents](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/addupdate-or-delete-documents)
    documents from an index

* `SearchIndexClient` allows you to:
  * [Create, delete, update, or configure a search index](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/index-operations)
  * [Declare custom synonym maps to expand or rewrite queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/synonym-map-operations)

* `SearchIndexerClient` allows you to:
  * [Create indexers to automatically crawl data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/indexer-operations)
  * [Define AI powered Skillsets to transform and enrich your data](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/skillset-operations)

_The `Azure.Search.Documents` client library (v11) is a brand new offering for
.NET developers who want to use search technology in their applications.  There
is an older, fully featured `Microsoft.Azure.Search` client library (v10) with
many similar looking APIs, so please be careful to avoid confusion when
exploring online resources.  A good rule of thumb is to check for the namespace
`using Azure.Search.Documents;` when you're looking for us._

### Thread safety
We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples

The following examples all use a simple [Hotel data set](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure-samples/azure-search-sample-data/azure-search-sample-data/)
that you can [import into your own index from the Azure portal.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-portal#step-1---start-the-import-data-wizard-and-create-a-data-source)
These are just a few of the basics - please [check out our Samples][samples] for

* [Async APIs](#async-apis)

### Querying

Let's start by importing our namespaces.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_Namespace
using Azure;
using Azure.Search.Documents;
using Azure.Search.Documents.Indexes;
```

We'll then create a `SearchClient` to access our hotels search index.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_Client
// Get the service endpoint and API key from the environment
Uri endpoint = new Uri(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SEARCH_ENDPOINT"));
string key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SEARCH_API_KEY");
string indexName = "hotels";

// Create a client
AzureKeyCredential credential = new AzureKeyCredential(key);
SearchClient client = new SearchClient(endpoint, indexName, credential);
```

There are two ways to interact with the data returned from a search query.
Let's explore them with a search for a "luxury" hotel.

#### Use C# types for search results

We can decorate our own C# types with [attributes from `System.Text.Json`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-how-to):

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_StaticType
public class Hotel
{
    [JsonPropertyName("HotelId")]
    [SimpleField(IsKey = true, IsFilterable = true, IsSortable = true)]
    public string Id { get; set; }

    [JsonPropertyName("HotelName")]
    [SearchableField(IsFilterable = true, IsSortable = true)]
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

Then we use them as the type parameter when querying to return strongly-typed search results:

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_StaticQuery
SearchResults<Hotel> response = client.Search<Hotel>("luxury");
foreach (SearchResult<Hotel> result in response.GetResults())
{
    Hotel doc = result.Document;
    Console.WriteLine($"{doc.Id}: {doc.Name}");
}
```

If you're working with a search index and know the schema, creating C# types
is recommended.

#### Use `SearchDocument` like a dictionary for search results

If you don't have your own type for search results, `SearchDocument` can be
used instead.  Here we perform the search, enumerate over the results, and
extract data using `SearchDocument`'s dictionary indexer.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_Dict
SearchResults<SearchDocument> response = client.Search<SearchDocument>("luxury");
foreach (SearchResult<SearchDocument> result in response.GetResults())
{
    SearchDocument doc = result.Document;
    string id = (string)doc["HotelId"];
    string name = (string)doc["HotelName"];
    Console.WriteLine("{id}: {name}");
}
```

#### SearchOptions

The `SearchOptions` provide powerful control over the behavior of our queries.
Let's search for the top 5 luxury hotels with a good rating.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_Options
int stars = 4;
SearchOptions options = new SearchOptions
{
    // Filter to only Rating greater than or equal our preference
    Filter = SearchFilter.Create($"Rating ge {stars}"),
    Size = 5, // Take only 5 results
    OrderBy = { "Rating desc" } // Sort by Rating from high to low
};
SearchResults<Hotel> response = client.Search<Hotel>("luxury", options);
// ...
```

### Creating an index

You can use the `SearchIndexClient` to create a search index. Fields can be
defined from a model class using `FieldBuilder`. Indexes can also define
suggesters, lexical analyzers, and more:

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_CreateIndex
Uri endpoint = new Uri(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SEARCH_ENDPOINT"));
string key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SEARCH_API_KEY");

// Create a service client
AzureKeyCredential credential = new AzureKeyCredential(key);
SearchIndexClient client = new SearchIndexClient(endpoint, credential);

// Create the index using FieldBuilder.
SearchIndex index = new SearchIndex("hotels")
{
    Fields = new FieldBuilder().Build(typeof(Hotel)),
    Suggesters =
    {
        // Suggest query terms from the hotelName field.
        new SearchSuggester("sg", "hotelName")
    }
};

client.CreateIndex(index);
```

In scenarios when the model is not known or cannot be modified, you can
also create fields explicitly using convenient `SimpleField`,
`SearchableField`, or `ComplexField` classes:

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_CreateManualIndex
// Create the index using field definitions.
SearchIndex index = new SearchIndex("hotels")
{
    Fields =
    {
        new SimpleField("hotelId", SearchFieldDataType.String) { IsKey = true, IsFilterable = true, IsSortable = true },
        new SearchableField("hotelName") { IsFilterable = true, IsSortable = true },
        new SearchableField("description") { AnalyzerName = LexicalAnalyzerName.EnLucene },
        new SearchableField("tags", collection: true) { IsFilterable = true, IsFacetable = true },
        new ComplexField("address")
        {
            Fields =
            {
                new SearchableField("streetAddress"),
                new SearchableField("city") { IsFilterable = true, IsSortable = true, IsFacetable = true },
                new SearchableField("stateProvince") { IsFilterable = true, IsSortable = true, IsFacetable = true },
                new SearchableField("country") { IsFilterable = true, IsSortable = true, IsFacetable = true },
                new SearchableField("postalCode") { IsFilterable = true, IsSortable = true, IsFacetable = true }
            }
        }
    },
    Suggesters =
    {
        // Suggest query terms from the hotelName field.
        new SearchSuggester("sg", "hotelName")
    }
};

client.CreateIndex(index);
```

### Adding documents to your index

You can `Upload`, `Merge`, `MergeOrUpload`, and `Delete` multiple documents from
an index in a single batched request.  There are
[a few special rules for merging](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/addupdate-or-delete-documents#document-actions)
to be aware of.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_Index
IndexDocumentsBatch<Hotel> batch = IndexDocumentsBatch.Create(
    IndexDocumentsAction.Upload(new Hotel { Id = "783", Name = "Upload Inn" }),
    IndexDocumentsAction.Merge(new Hotel { Id = "12", Name = "Renovated Ranch" }));

IndexDocumentsOptions options = new IndexDocumentsOptions { ThrowOnAnyError = true };
client.IndexDocuments(batch, options);
```

The request will succeed even if any of the individual actions fail and
return an `IndexDocumentsResult` for inspection.  There's also a `ThrowOnAnyError`
option if you only care about success or failure of the whole batch.

### Retrieving a specific document from your index

In addition to querying for documents using keywords and optional filters,
you can retrieve a specific document from your index if you already know the
key. You could get the key from a query, for example, and want to show more
information about it or navigate your customer to that document.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_GetDocument
Hotel doc = client.GetDocument<Hotel>("1");
Console.WriteLine($"{doc.Id}: {doc.Name}");
```

### Async APIs

All of the examples so far have been using synchronous APIs, but we provide full
support for async APIs as well.  You'll generally just add an `Async` suffix to
the name of the method and `await` it.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_StaticQueryAsync
SearchResults<Hotel> response = await client.SearchAsync<Hotel>("luxury");
await foreach (SearchResult<Hotel> result in response.GetResultsAsync())
{
    Hotel doc = result.Document;
    Console.WriteLine($"{doc.Id}: {doc.Name}");
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Any Azure.Search.Documents operation that fails will throw a
[`RequestFailedException`][RequestFailedException] with
helpful [`Status` codes][status_codes].  Many of these errors are recoverable.

```C# Snippet:Azure_Search_Tests_Samples_Readme_Troubleshooting
try
{
    return client.GetDocument<Hotel>("12345");
}
catch (RequestFailedException ex) when (ex.Status == 404)
{
    Console.WriteLine("We couldn't find the hotel you are looking for!");
    Console.WriteLine("Please try selecting another.");
    return null;
}
```

You can also easily [enable console logging](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/core/Azure.Core/samples/Diagnostics.md#logging) if you want to dig
deeper into the requests you're making against the service.
