Truncating the vectors reduces the size of the vectors and the amount of data that needs to be transferred during search. This can save storage cost and improve search performance at the expense of recall. It should be only used for embeddings trained with Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) such as OpenAI text-embedding-3-large (small). The default value is null, which means no truncation. </param>

        /// <param name="defaultOversampling"> Default oversampling factor. Oversampling will internally request more documents (specified by this multiplier) in the initial search. This increases the set of results that will be reranked using recomputed similarity scores from full-precision vectors. Minimum value is 1, meaning no oversampling (1x). This parameter can only be set when rerankWithOriginalVectors is true. Higher values improve recall at the expense of latency. </param>
