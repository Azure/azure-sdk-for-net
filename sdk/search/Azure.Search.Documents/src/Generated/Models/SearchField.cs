If you set a searchable field to a value like &quot;sunny day&quot;, internally it will be split into the individual tokens &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;day&quot;. This enables full-text searches for these terms. Fields of type Edm.String or Collection(Edm.String) are searchable by default. This property must be false for simple fields of other non-string data types, and it must be null for complex fields. Note: searchable fields consume extra space in your index since Azure Cognitive Search will store an additional tokenized version of the field value for full-text searches.

Fields of type Edm.String or Collection(Edm.String) that are filterable do not undergo word-breaking, so comparisons are for exact matches only. For example, if you set such a field f to &quot;sunny day&quot;, $filter=f eq &apos;sunny&apos; will find no matches, but $filter=f eq &apos;sunny day&apos; will. This property must be null for complex fields. Default is true for simple fields and null for complex fields. </param>

By default Azure Cognitive Search sorts results by score, but in many experiences users will want to sort by fields in the documents. A simple field can be sortable only if it is single-valued (it has a single value in the scope of the parent document). Simple collection fields cannot be sortable, since they are multi-valued. Simple sub-fields of complex collections are also multi-valued, and therefore cannot be sortable. This is true whether it&apos;s an immediate parent field, or an ancestor field, that&apos;s the complex collection. Complex fields cannot be sortable and the sortable property must be null for such fields. The default for sortable is true for single-valued simple fields, false for multi-valued simple fields, and null for complex fields. </param>
