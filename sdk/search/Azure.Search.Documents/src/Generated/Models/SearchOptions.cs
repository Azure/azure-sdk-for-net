This parameter can be useful for ensuring search availability even for services with only one replica. The default is 100. </param>
        /// <param name="orderByRaw"> The comma-separated list of OData $orderby expressions by which to sort the results. Each expression can be either a field name or a call to either the geo.distance() or the search.score() functions. Each expression can be followed by asc to indicate ascending, or desc to indicate descending. The default is ascending order. Ties will be broken by the match scores of documents. If no $orderby is specified, the default sort order is descending by document match score. There can be at most 32 $orderby clauses. </param>

The default is &apos;local&apos;. Use &apos;global&apos; to aggregate scoring statistics globally before scoring. Using global scoring statistics can increase latency of search queries. </param>

As long as the same sessionId is used, a best-effort attempt will be made to target the same replica set. Be wary that reusing the same sessionID values repeatedly can interfere with the load balancing of the requests across replicas and adversely affect the performance of the search service. The value used as sessionId cannot start with a &apos;_&apos; character. </param>

For example, if the scoring profile defines a function with a parameter called &apos;mylocation&apos; the parameter string would be &quot;mylocation--122.2,44.8&quot; (without the quotes). </param>

        /// <param name="searchFieldsRaw"> The comma-separated list of field names to which to scope the full-text search. When using fielded search (fieldName:searchExpression) in a full Lucene query, the field names of each fielded search expression take precedence over any field names listed in this parameter. </param>
        /// <param name="searchMode"> A value that specifies whether any or all of the search terms must be matched in order to count the document as a match. </param>
        /// <param name="queryLanguage"> A value that specifies the language of the search query. </param>
        /// <param name="querySpeller"> A value that specified the type of the speller to use to spell-correct individual search query terms. </param>
        /// <param name="queryAnswerRaw"> A value that specifies whether answers should be returned as part of the search response. </param>

        /// <param name="size"> The number of search results to retrieve. This can be used in conjunction with $skip to implement client-side paging of search results. If results are truncated due to server-side paging, the response will include a continuation token that can be used to issue another Search request for the next page of results. </param>
