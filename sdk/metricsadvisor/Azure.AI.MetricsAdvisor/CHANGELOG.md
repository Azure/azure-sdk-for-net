# Release History

## 1.0.0-beta.5 (Unreleased)

### Breaking Changes
- The whole `DatasourceCredential` API has been renamed to `DataSourceCredential`. This includes renames in types, methods, and properties.
- Split the method `GetAnomalies` into two different methods: `GetAnomaliesForAlert` and `GetAnomaliesForDetectionConfiguration`.
- Split the method `GetIncidents` into two different methods: `GetIncidentsForAlert` and `GetIncidentsForDetectionConfiguration`.
- `DataFeedIngestionSettings` constructor now takes the required `ingestionStartTime` parameter. For this reason, the property `IngestionStartTime` is not nullable anymore.
- `DataFeedMissingDataPointFillSettings` constructor now takes the required `fillType` parameter. For this reason, the property `FillType` is not nullable anymore.
- `EmailNotificationHook` constructor now takes the required `name` parameter.
- `WebNotificationHook` constructor now takes the required `name` and `endpoint` parameters.
- In `MetricSeriesData`, removed the `Definition` property. Now, properties `MetricId` and `SeriesKey` can be accessed directly from `MetricSeriesData`.
- In `DataPointAnomaly`, renamed property `AnomalyDetectionConfigurationId` to `DetectionConfigurationId`.
- In `DataFeedMetric`, renamed constructor parameter `metricName` to `name` only.
- In `DataFeedDimension`, renamed constructor parameter `dimensionName` to `name` only.
- Moved `GetAlertConfigurationsOptions`, `GetDatasourceCredentialsOptions`, and `GetDetectionConfigurationsOptions` to the `Azure.AI.MetricsAdvisor.Administration` namespace.
- Moved `DatasourceCredential`, `DataFeedSource`, `NotificationHook`, and all of their concrete child types to the `Azure.AI.MetricsAdvisor.Administration` namespace.
- Moved `MetricFeedback` and all of its concrete child types to the `Azure.AI.MetricsAdvisor` namespace.
- Changed order of parameters of `MetricsAdvisorClient.GetMetricEnrichedSeriesData`. Now, `detectionConfigurationId` appears first.
- In `MetricsAdvisorKeyCredential`, merged `UpdateSubscriptionKey` and `UpdateApiKey` into a single method, `Update`, to make it an atomic operation.

## 1.0.0-beta.4 (2021-06-07)

### New Features
- Added `DatasourceCredential` CRUD operations to the `MetricsAdvisorAdministrationClient`. This API provides new ways of authenticating to a `DataFeedSource`.
- Added property `Authentication` to data sources `AzureBlobDataFeedSource`, `AzureDataExplorerDataFeedSource`, `AzureDataLakeStorageGen2DataFeedSource`, and `SqlServerDataFeedSource` to specify the authentication type to use.
- Added property `DatasourceCredentialId` to data sources `AzureDataExplorerDataFeedSource`, `AzureDataLakeStorageGen2DataFeedSource`, and `SqlServerDataFeedSource` to specify the datasource credential to use for authentication.
- Added properties `Value` and `ExpectedValue` to `DataPointAnomaly` to provide more information about the anomalous data point.
- Added properties `ValueOfRootNode` and `ExpectedValueOfRootNode` to `AnomalyIncident` to provide more information about the anomalous data point at the root node of the indicent.
- Response headers that were marked as `REDACTED` in error messages and logs are now exposed by default.
- `GetDetectionConfigurations` and `GetAlertConfigurations` in the `MetricsAdvisorAdministrationClient` can now take a set of options with `Skip` and `MaxPageSize` properties to configure paging behavior.
- Added setters to models that use the Update APIs to make updating easier.
- Added property `DataFeedId` to `DataPointAnomaly` and `AnomalyIncident`.
- Added two new data feed sources: `AzureEventHubsDataFeedSource` and `LogAnalyticsDataFeedSource`.

### Breaking Changes
- Update methods will now return the updated entity instead of an empty response. For example, `UpdateDataFeed` now returns a `Response<DataFeed>`.
- `NotificationHook.ExternalLink` and `WebNotificationHook.Endpoint` are now of type `Uri`.
- Removed setter from `GetIncidentsForDetectionConfigurationOptions.DimensionsToFilter`. Elements can be added directly to it without user instantiation.

- Renamed all `TopCount` listing options to `MaxPageSize`. Affected classes include `GetAlertsOptions`, `GetDataFeedsOptions`, `GetHooksOptions`, and others.
- Removed data feed sources `ElasticsearchDataFeedSource` and `HttpRequestDataFeedSource` as they are not supported by the service anymore. A different type of data feed source must be used for data ingestion instead.
- Removed getters for secrets in data feed sources, such as `AzureBlobDataFeedSource.ConnectionString` and `InfluxDbDataFeedSource.Password`.
- Removed granularity type `DataFeedGranularityType.PerSecond` as it's not supported by the service anymore.
- Renamed method `GetDimensionValues` to `GetMetricDimensionValues` in `MetricsAdvisorClient`. The associated options type `GetDimensionValuesOptions` has been renamed as well.

- In `MetricsAdvisorAdministrationClient`, Update operations such as `UpdateDataFeed` don't take the ID as a method parameter anymore. You now need to pass an instance that has been returned from another CRUD operation and has its `Id` property populated.
- In `AnomalyIncident`, renamed `DimensionKey` to `RootDimensionKey`.
- In `DataFeed`, renamed `Administrators` to `AdministratorsEmails`, `Creator` to `CreatorEmail`, and `Viewers` to `ViewersEmails`.

- In `IncidentRootCause`, renamed `DimensionKey` to `SeriesKey`, and `Score` to `ContributionScore`.
- In `MetricBoundaryCondition`, renamed `TriggerForMissing` to `ShouldAlertIfDataPointMissing`.
- In `MetricEnrichedSeriesData`, renamed `Values` to `MetricValues`, `ExpectedValues` to `ExpectedMetricValues`, `LowerBoundaries` to `LowerBoundaryValues`, and `UpperBoundaries` to `UpperBoundaryValues`.
