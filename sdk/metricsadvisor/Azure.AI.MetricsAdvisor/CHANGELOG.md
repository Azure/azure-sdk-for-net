# Release History

## 1.0.0-beta.4 (Unreleased)

### New Features
- Added properties `Value` and `ExpectedValue` to `DataPointAnomaly` to provide more information about the anomalous data point.

### Breaking Changes
- `NotificationHook.ExternalLink` and `WebNotificationHook.Endpoint` are now of type `Uri`.
