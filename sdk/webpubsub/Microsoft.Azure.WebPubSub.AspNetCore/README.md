# Azure Web PubSub service middleware client library for .NET

[Azure Web PubSub Service](https://aka.ms/awps/doc) is a service that enables you to build real-time messaging web applications using WebSockets and the publish-subscribe pattern. Any platform supporting WebSocket APIs can connect to the service easily, e.g. web pages, mobile applications, edge devices, etc. The service manages the WebSocket connections for you and allows up to 100K **concurrent** connections. It provides powerful APIs for you to manage these clients and deliver real-time messages.

Any scenario that requires real-time publish-subscribe messaging between server and clients or among clients, can use Azure Web PubSub service. Traditional real-time features that often require polling from server or submitting HTTP requests, can also use Azure Web PubSub service.

This library can be used to do the following actions. Details about the terms used here are described in [Key concepts](#key-concepts) section.

- Parse upstream request under CloudNative CloudEvents
- Add validation options for upstream request
- API to add user defined functionality to handle different upstream events

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the client library from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/):

```PowerShell
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebPubSub.AspNetCore --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites

- An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
- An existing Azure Web PubSub service instance.

### Authenticate the client

In order to interact with the service, you'll need to create an instance of the WebPubSubServiceClient class. To make this possible, you'll need the connection string or a key, which you can access in the Azure portal.

### Create a `WebPubSubServiceClient`

```C# Snippet:WebPubSubAuthenticate
// Create a WebPubSubServiceClient that will authenticate using a key credential.
var serviceClient = new WebPubSubServiceClient(new Uri(endpoint), "some_hub", new AzureKeyCredential(key));
```

## Key concepts

For information about general Web PubSub concepts [Concepts in Azure Web PubSub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-web-pubsub/key-concepts)

### `WebPubSubHub`

`WebPubSubHub` is an abstract class to let users implement the subscribed Web PubSub service events. After user register the [event handler](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-web-pubsub/howto-develop-eventhandler) in service side, these events will be forwarded from service to server. And `WebPubSubHub` provides 4 methods mapping to the service events to enable users deal with these events, for example, client management, validations or working with `Azure.Messaging.WebPubSub` to broadcast the messages. See samples below for details.

> NOTE
>
> Among the 4 methods, `OnConnectAsync()` and `OnMessageReceivedAsync()` are blocking events that service will respect server returns. Besides the mapped correct response, server can throw exceptions whenever the request is against the server side logic. And `UnauthorizedAccessException` will be converted to `401Unauthorized` and rest will be converted to `500InternalServerError` along with exception message to return service. Then service will drop current client connection.

## Examples

### Add Web PubSub service with options

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddWebPubSub(o =>
    {
        o.ValidationOptions.Add("<connection-string>");
    });
}
```

### Map `WebPubSubHub` to endpoint routing

The path should match the value configured in the Azure Web PubSub service `EventHandler`. For example, if placeholder is using like `/api/{event}`, then the path set in code should be `/api/{event}` as well.

```C#
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoint =>
    {
        endpoint.MapWebPubSubHub<SampleHub>("/eventhander");
    });
}
```

### Handle Upstream event

```C#
public override ValueTask<ConnectEventResponse> OnConnectAsync(ConnectEventRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var response = new ConnectEventResponse
    {
        UserId = request.ConnectionContext.UserId
    };
    return new ValueTask<ConnectEventResponse>(response);
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Setting up console logging

You can also easily [enable console logging](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/core/Azure.Core/samples/Diagnostics.md#logging) if you want to dig deeper into the requests you're making against the service.
