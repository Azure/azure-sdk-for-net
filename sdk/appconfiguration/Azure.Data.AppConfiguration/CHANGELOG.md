### Bugs Fixed

### Other Changes

## 1.3.0-beta.3 (2023-10-09)

### Features Added

- Added a new type, `SnapshotSelector`, to encapsulate parameters like `name`, `fields`, and `status` within the `GetSnapshots` method.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed `GetConfigurationSettings(SettingSelector)` not setting `ContentType` and `LastModified` properties [(#38524)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/38524).
- `FeatureFlagConfigurationSetting`  will now allow custom attributes under the `conditions` element in the setting value.  Previously, only `client_filters` was recognized and other data would be discarded.

## 1.2.1 (2023-09-13)

### Bugs Fixed

- `FeatureFlagConfigurationSetting` and `SecretReferenceConfigurationSetting` will now retain custom attributes in the setting value.  Previously, only attributes that were defined in the associated JSON schema were allowed and unknown attributes were discarded.
- Added the ability to create `FeatureFlagConfigurationSetting` and `SecretReferenceConfigurationSetting` instances with an ETag, matching `ConfigurationSetting`.  This allows all setting types to use the [GetConfigurationSettingAsync](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.data.appconfiguration.configurationclient.getconfigurationsettingasync?view=azure-dotnet#azure-data-appconfiguration-configurationclient-getconfigurationsettingasync(azure-data-appconfiguration-configurationsetting-system-boolean-system-threading-cancellationtoken)) overload that accepts `onlyIfUnchanged.`  Previously, this was not possible for specialized settings types.
- Added the ability to create `FeatureFlagConfigurationSetting` and `SecretReferenceConfigurationSetting` instances for testing purposes using the `ConfigurationModelFactory`. It was previously not possible to populate service-owned fields when testing.
- Marked a constructor overload of `ConfigurationSetting` that was intended for testing purposes as non-visible, as the `ConfigurationModelFactory` should instead be used.
- Fixed a bug where a disposed content stream was used to attempt deserialization in some scenarios, such as using a custom `HttpMessageHandler` that returns `StringContent`.
