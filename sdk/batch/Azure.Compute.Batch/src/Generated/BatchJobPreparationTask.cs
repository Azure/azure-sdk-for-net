    /// resource files used by all the Tasks in the Job. The Job Preparation Task can
    /// download these common resource files to the shared location on the Node.
    /// (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\shared), or starting a local service on the Node so
    /// that all Tasks of that Job can communicate with it. If the Job Preparation Task
    /// fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before exiting with exit code 0),
    /// Batch will not run Tasks of this Job on the Node. The Compute Node remains
    /// ineligible to run Tasks of this Job until it is reimaged. The Compute Node
    /// remains active and can be used for other Jobs. The Job Preparation Task can run
    /// multiple times on the same Node. Therefore, you should write the Job
    /// Preparation Task to handle re-execution. If the Node is rebooted, the Job
    /// Preparation Task is run again on the Compute Node before scheduling any other
    /// Task of the Job, if rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job
    /// Preparation Task did not previously complete. If the Node is reimaged, the Job
    /// Preparation Task is run again before scheduling any Task of the Job. Batch will
    /// retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of
    /// recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is
    /// rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to
    /// recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the
    /// maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to
    /// a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be
    /// idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted
    /// without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long
    /// running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.
