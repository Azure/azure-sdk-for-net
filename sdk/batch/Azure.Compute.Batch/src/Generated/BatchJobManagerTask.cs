    /// Specifies details of a Job Manager Task.
    /// The Job Manager Task is automatically started when the Job is created. The
    /// Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager Task before any other Tasks in
    /// the Job. When shrinking a Pool, the Batch service tries to preserve Nodes where
    /// Job Manager Tasks are running for as long as possible (that is, Compute Nodes
    /// running 'normal' Tasks are removed before Compute Nodes running Job Manager
    /// Tasks). When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be restarted, the system
    /// tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle Compute
    /// Nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running Tasks in the Pool
    /// and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager Task to
    /// restart. Note that a Job Manager Task in one Job does not have priority over
    /// Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only Job level priorities are observed. For
    /// example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job needs to be restarted, it will
    /// not displace Tasks of a priority 1 Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery
    /// operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but
    /// are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node
    /// disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are
    /// independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the
    /// maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may
    /// occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need
    /// to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or
    /// duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of
    /// checkpointing.
