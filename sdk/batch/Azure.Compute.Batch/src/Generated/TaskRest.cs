The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using &quot;cmd /c MyCommand&quot; in Windows or &quot;/bin/sh -c MyCommand&quot; in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with &quot;.&quot; it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in &apos;.&apos; and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries)

The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using &quot;cmd /c MyCommand&quot; in Windows or &quot;/bin/sh -c MyCommand&quot; in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

If the Pool that will run this Task doesn&apos;t have containerConfiguration set, this must not be set. When this is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all Task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task command line is executed in the container. Files produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.

This URL must be readable and listable from compute nodes. There are three ways to get such a URL for a container in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read and list permissions on the container, use a managed identity with read and list permissions, or set the ACL for the container to allow public access.
        ///       httpUrl: string, # Optional. The autoStorageContainerName, storageContainerUrl and httpUrl properties are mutually exclusive and one of them must be specified. If the URL points to Azure Blob Storage, it must be readable from compute nodes.

Otherwise, if the autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is specified, filePath is optional and is the directory to download the files to. In the case where filePath is used as a directory, any directory structure already associated with the input data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the Task&apos;s working directory (for example by using &apos;..&apos;).
        ///       fileMode: string, # Optional. This property applies only to files being downloaded to Linux Compute Nodes. It will be ignored if it is specified for a resourceFile which will be downloaded to a Windows Compute Node. If this property is not specified for a Linux Compute Node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.

There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
        ///   outputFiles: [

        ///       filePattern: string, # Required. Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to the Task working directory. The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with &quot;.&quot; it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in &apos;.&apos; and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

If filePattern contains one or more wildcards (and therefore may match multiple files), then path is the name of the blob virtual directory (which is prepended to each blob name) to which to upload the file(s). If omitted, file(s) are uploaded to the root of the container with a blob name matching their file name.

The Batch service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries)

The difference between common resource files and Task resource files is that common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary, whereas Task resource files are downloaded only for the primary. Also note that these resource files are not downloaded to the Task working directory, but instead are downloaded to the Task root directory (one directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.

In the MPI case, if any of the subtasks fail (for example due to exiting with a non-zero exit code) the entire multi-instance Task fails.

Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the Node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the Compute Node is used.

If this property is set, the Batch service provides the Task with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add other Tasks to the Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.

        /// Note that each Task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not return the results for each Task in the same order the Tasks were submitted in this request. If the server times out or the connection is closed during the request, the request may have been partially or fully processed, or not at all. In such cases, the user should re-issue the request. Note that it is up to the user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use the same Task IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation succeeded, the retry will not create extra Tasks unexpectedly. If the response contains any Tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In a retry, it is most efficient to resubmit only Tasks that failed to add, and to omit Tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt. The maximum lifetime of a Task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a Task has not completed within 180 days of being added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.

If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using &quot;cmd /c MyCommand&quot; in Windows or &quot;/bin/sh -c MyCommand&quot; in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

Files produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.

Otherwise, if the autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is specified, filePath is optional and is the directory to download the files to. In the case where filePath is used as a directory, any directory structure already associated with the input data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the Task&apos;s working directory (for example by using &apos;..&apos;).

There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.

The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with &quot;.&quot; it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in &apos;.&apos; and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt.

The difference between common resource files and Task resource files is that common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary, whereas Task resource files are downloaded only for the primary. Also note that these resource files are not downloaded to the Task working directory, but instead are downloaded to the Task root directory (one directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.

In the MPI case, if any of the subtasks fail (for example due to exiting with a non-zero exit code) the entire multi-instance Task fails.

The token is provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add other Tasks to the Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.

        /// Note that each Task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not return the results for each Task in the same order the Tasks were submitted in this request. If the server times out or the connection is closed during the request, the request may have been partially or fully processed, or not at all. In such cases, the user should re-issue the request. Note that it is up to the user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use the same Task IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation succeeded, the retry will not create extra Tasks unexpectedly. If the response contains any Tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In a retry, it is most efficient to resubmit only Tasks that failed to add, and to omit Tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt. The maximum lifetime of a Task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a Task has not completed within 180 days of being added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.

If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using &quot;cmd /c MyCommand&quot; in Windows or &quot;/bin/sh -c MyCommand&quot; in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

Files produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.

Otherwise, if the autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is specified, filePath is optional and is the directory to download the files to. In the case where filePath is used as a directory, any directory structure already associated with the input data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the Task&apos;s working directory (for example by using &apos;..&apos;).

The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with &quot;.&quot; it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in &apos;.&apos; and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt.

For multi-instance Tasks, the command line is executed as the primary Task, after the primary Task and all subtasks have finished executing the coordination command line. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using &quot;cmd /c MyCommand&quot; in Windows or &quot;/bin/sh -c MyCommand&quot; in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

When this is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all Task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task command line is executed in the container. Files produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.

This URL must be readable and listable from compute nodes. There are three ways to get such a URL for a container in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read and list permissions on the container, use a managed identity with read and list permissions, or set the ACL for the container to allow public access.

Otherwise, if the autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is specified, filePath is optional and is the directory to download the files to. In the case where filePath is used as a directory, any directory structure already associated with the input data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the Task&apos;s working directory (for example by using &apos;..&apos;).
        ///       fileMode: string, # Optional. This property applies only to files being downloaded to Linux Compute Nodes. It will be ignored if it is specified for a resourceFile which will be downloaded to a Windows Compute Node. If this property is not specified for a Linux Compute Node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.

There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
        ///   outputFiles: [

        ///       filePattern: string, # Required. Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to the Task working directory. The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with &quot;.&quot; it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in &apos;.&apos; and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

If filePattern contains one or more wildcards (and therefore may match multiple files), then path is the name of the blob virtual directory (which is prepended to each blob name) to which to upload the file(s). If omitted, file(s) are uploaded to the root of the container with a blob name matching their file name.

If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries)

In general, the exit code for a process reflects the specific convention implemented by the application developer for that process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code convention used by the application process. However, if the Batch service terminates the Task (due to timeout, or user termination via the API) you may see an operating system-defined exit code.

The difference between common resource files and Task resource files is that common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary, whereas Task resource files are downloaded only for the primary. Also note that these resource files are not downloaded to the Task working directory, but instead are downloaded to the Task root directory (one directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.

If this property is set, the Batch service provides the Task with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add other Tasks to the Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.

If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using &quot;cmd /c MyCommand&quot; in Windows or &quot;/bin/sh -c MyCommand&quot; in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with &quot;.&quot; it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in &apos;.&apos; and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries)

The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with &quot;.&quot; it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in &apos;.&apos; and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries)

For multi-instance Tasks, the command line is executed as the primary Task, after the primary Task and all subtasks have finished executing the coordination command line. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using &quot;cmd /c MyCommand&quot; in Windows or &quot;/bin/sh -c MyCommand&quot; in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

If the Pool that will run this Task doesn&apos;t have containerConfiguration set, this must not be set. When this is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all Task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task command line is executed in the container. Files produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.

This URL must be readable and listable from compute nodes. There are three ways to get such a URL for a container in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read and list permissions on the container, use a managed identity with read and list permissions, or set the ACL for the container to allow public access.
        ///       httpUrl: string, # Optional. The autoStorageContainerName, storageContainerUrl and httpUrl properties are mutually exclusive and one of them must be specified. If the URL points to Azure Blob Storage, it must be readable from compute nodes. There are three ways to get such a URL for a blob in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read permissions on the blob, use a managed identity with read permission, or set the ACL for the blob or its container to allow public access.
        ///       blobPrefix: string, # Optional. The property is valid only when autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl is used. This prefix can be a partial filename or a subdirectory. If a prefix is not specified, all the files in the container will be downloaded.

Otherwise, if the autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is specified, filePath is optional and is the directory to download the files to. In the case where filePath is used as a directory, any directory structure already associated with the input data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the Task&apos;s working directory (for example by using &apos;..&apos;).
        ///       fileMode: string, # Optional. This property applies only to files being downloaded to Linux Compute Nodes. It will be ignored if it is specified for a resourceFile which will be downloaded to a Windows Compute Node. If this property is not specified for a Linux Compute Node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.

There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
        ///   outputFiles: [
        ///     {
        ///       filePattern: string, # Required. Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to the Task working directory. The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with &quot;.&quot; it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in &apos;.&apos; and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

If filePattern contains one or more wildcards (and therefore may match multiple files), then path is the name of the blob virtual directory (which is prepended to each blob name) to which to upload the file(s). If omitted, file(s) are uploaded to the root of the container with a blob name matching their file name.

The Batch service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries)

In general, the exit code for a process reflects the specific convention implemented by the application developer for that process.

There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge.

If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using &quot;cmd /c MyCommand&quot; in Windows or &quot;/bin/sh -c MyCommand&quot; in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

When this is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all Task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task command line is executed in the container. Files produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.

This URL must be readable and listable from compute nodes. There are three ways to get such a URL for a container in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS) granting read and list permissions on the container, use a managed identity with read and list permissions, or set the ACL for the container to allow public access.

In the case where filePath is used as a directory, any directory structure already associated with the input data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the Task&apos;s working directory (for example by using &apos;..&apos;).

The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with &quot;.&quot; it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in &apos;.&apos; and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

The difference between common resource files and Task resource files is that common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the primary, whereas Task resource files are downloaded only for the primary. Also note that these resource files are not downloaded to the Task working directory, but instead are downloaded to the Task root directory (one directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.

If this property is set, the Batch service provides the Task with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add other Tasks to the Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.

If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using &quot;cmd /c MyCommand&quot; in Windows or &quot;/bin/sh -c MyCommand&quot; in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

When this is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all Task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task command line is executed in the container. Files produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk, meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.

Otherwise, if the autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is specified, filePath is optional and is the directory to download the files to. In the case where filePath is used as a directory, any directory structure already associated with the input data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the Task&apos;s working directory (for example by using &apos;..&apos;).
        ///       fileMode: string, # Optional. This property applies only to files being downloaded to Linux Compute Nodes.

There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers.
        ///   outputFiles: [

        ///       filePattern: string, # Required. Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to the Task working directory. The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with &quot;.&quot; it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in &apos;.&apos; and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however this is not recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries)

If this property is set, the Batch service provides the Task with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without requiring an Account access key. The token is provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out using the token depend on the settings.
