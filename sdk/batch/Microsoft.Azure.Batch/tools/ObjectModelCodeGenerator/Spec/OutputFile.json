A simple example: **\\*.txt matches any file that does not start in '.' and ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory.</para><para>If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*).</para><para>Note that both \\ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux.</para><para>Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.</para>",
