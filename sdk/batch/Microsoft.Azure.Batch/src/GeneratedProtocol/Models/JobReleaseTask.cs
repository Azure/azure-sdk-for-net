    /// The Job Release Task runs when the Job ends, because of one of the
    /// following: The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API
    /// while the Job is still active, the Job's maximum wall clock time
    /// constraint is reached, and the Job is still active, or the Job's Job
    /// Manager Task completed, and the Job is configured to terminate when the
    /// Job Manager completes. The Job Release Task runs on each Node where
    /// Tasks of the Job have run and the Job Preparation Task ran and
    /// completed. If you reimage a Node after it has run the Job Preparation
    /// Task, and the Job ends without any further Tasks of the Job running on
    /// that Node (and hence the Job Preparation Task does not re-run), then
    /// the Job Release Task does not run on that Compute Node. If a Node
    /// reboots while the Job Release Task is still running, the Job Release
    /// Task runs again when the Compute Node starts up. The Job is not marked
    /// as complete until all Job Release Tasks have completed. The Job Release
    /// Task runs in the background. It does not occupy a scheduling slot; that
