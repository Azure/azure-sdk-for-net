  "RemarksComment": "Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the <see cref=\"TaskConstraints.MaxTaskRetryCount\" />. Even if the <see cref=\"TaskConstraints.MaxTaskRetryCount\" /> is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of checkpointing. The maximum lifetime of a task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a task has not completed within 180 days of being added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.",
