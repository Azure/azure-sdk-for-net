# Deserializing Events Delivered to Event Handlers

This sample will demonstrate how to deserialize events that have been delivered to event handlers. There are several different Azure services that act as [event handlers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/event-handlers). Regardless of the event handler, however, events are always sent as UTF-8 encoded JSON.

Note: if using Webhooks for event delivery of the *Event Grid schema*, Event Grid requires you to prove ownership of your Webhook endpoint before it starts delivering events to that endpoint. At the time of event subscription creation, Event Grid sends a subscription validation event to your endpoint, as seen below. Learn more about completing the handshake here: [Webhook event delivery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/webhook-event-delivery). For the *CloudEvents schema*, the service validates the connection using the HTTP options method. Learn more here: [CloudEvents validation](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/http-webhook.md#4-abuse-protection).

Handling events will be different based on which schema the event was delivered as. However, the general pattern will remain the same:
- Parse events from JSON into individual events. Based on the event schema (Event Grid or CloudEvents 1.0), you can now access basic information about the event on the envelope (properties that are present for all events, like event time and type).
- Deserialize the event data. Given an `EventGridEvent` or `CloudEvent`, the user can attempt to access the event payload, or data, by deserializing to a specific type. You can supply a custom serializer at this point to correctly decode the data.

## Parse Events from JSON payload
Once events are delivered to the event handler, parse the JSON payload into list of events.

Using `EventGridEvent`:
```C# Snippet:EGEventParseJson
// Parse the JSON payload into a list of events using EventGridEvent.Parse
EventGridEvent[] egEvents = EventGridEvent.Parse(jsonPayloadSampleOne);
```

Using `CloudEvent`:
```C# Snippet:CloudEventParseJson
// Parse the JSON payload into a list of events using CloudEvent.Parse
CloudEvent[] cloudEvents = CloudEvent.Parse(jsonPayloadSampleTwo);
```

## Deserialize Event Data
From here, one can access the event data by deserializing to a specific type using `GetData<T>()` and passing in a custom serializer if necessary. Calling `GetData()` will either return a deserialized system event (an event generated by an Azure service), or the event data wrapped in `BinaryData`, which represents the serialized JSON event data as bytes.
### Using `GetData<T>()`
Below is an example calling `GetData<T>()` for CloudEvents. In order to deserialize to the correct type, the `EventType` property (`Type` for CloudEvents) helps distinguish between different events. Custom event data should be deserialized using the generic method `GetData<T>()`. There is also an overload for `GetData<T>()` that accepts a custom `ObjectSerializer` to deserialize the event data.

```C# Snippet:DeserializePayloadUsingGenericGetData
foreach (CloudEvent cloudEvent in cloudEvents)
{
    switch (cloudEvent.Type)
    {
        case "Contoso.Items.ItemReceived":
            // By default, GetData uses JsonObjectSerializer to deserialize the payload
            ContosoItemReceivedEventData itemReceived = cloudEvent.GetData<ContosoItemReceivedEventData>();
            Console.WriteLine(itemReceived.ItemSku);
            break;
        case "MyApp.Models.CustomEventType":
            // One can also specify a custom ObjectSerializer as needed to deserialize the payload correctly
            TestPayload testPayload = await cloudEvent.GetDataAsync<TestPayload>(myCustomSerializer);
            Console.WriteLine(testPayload.Name);
            break;
        case "Microsoft.Storage.BlobDeleted":
            // Example for deserializing system events using GetData<T>
            StorageBlobDeletedEventData blobDeleted = cloudEvent.GetData<StorageBlobDeletedEventData>();
            Console.WriteLine(blobDeleted.BlobType);
            break;
    }
}
```

### Using `GetData()`
If expecting mostly system events, it may be cleaner to switch on object `GetData()` and use pattern matching to deserialize events. In the case where there are unrecognized event types, one can use the returned `BinaryData` to deserialize the custom event data.

```C# Snippet:DeserializePayloadUsingNonGenericGetData
foreach (EventGridEvent egEvent in egEvents)
{
    // If the event is a system event, GetData() should return the correct system event type
    switch (egEvent.GetData())
    {
        case SubscriptionValidationEventData subscriptionValidated:
            Console.WriteLine(subscriptionValidated.ValidationCode);
            break;
        case StorageBlobCreatedEventData blobCreated:
            Console.WriteLine(blobCreated.BlobType);
            break;
        case BinaryData unknownType:
            // An unrecognized event type - GetData() returns BinaryData with the serialized JSON payload
            if (egEvent.EventType == "MyApp.Models.CustomEventType")
            {
                // You can use BinaryData methods to deserialize the payload
                TestPayload deserializedEventData = await unknownType.ToObjectAsync<TestPayload>();
                Console.WriteLine(deserializedEventData.Name);
            }
            break;
    }
}
```
