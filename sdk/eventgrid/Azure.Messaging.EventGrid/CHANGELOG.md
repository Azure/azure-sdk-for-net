## 4.0.0-beta.1 (2020-09-08)
This is the first preview of the Azure Event Grid client library that follows the [.NET Azure SDK Design Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html). This library is not a drop-in replacement for `Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid`, as code changes would be required to use the new library.

This package's [documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/eventgrid/Azure.Messaging.EventGrid/README.md) and [samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/eventgrid/Azure.Messaging.EventGrid/samples/README.md) demonstrate the new API.
### Features:
- Configurable publisher client that supports sending user-defined events of the Event Grid, CloudEvents v1.0, or custom schema.
- Ability to parse and deserialize system or user-defined events from JSON to events of the Event Grid or CloudEvents schema.
