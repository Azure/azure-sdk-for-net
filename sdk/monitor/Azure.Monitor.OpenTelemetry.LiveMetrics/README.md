# Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry LiveMetrics code sharing library

This library is intended to serve as a common location for non-public code for the [Live Metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/live-stream) REST API.
The [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Exporter](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/monitor/Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Exporter) includes these artifacts by shared links to enable them to be loosely hosted within those projects rather than consumed by direct project or package reference.
