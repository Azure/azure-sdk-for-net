# Azure Monitor Exporter client library for .NET

The [OpenTelemetry .NET](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet) exporters which send [telemetry data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/data-model) to [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) following the [OpenTelemetry Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Subscription:**  To use Azure services, including Azure Monitor Exporter for [OpenTelemetry .NET](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet), you'll need a subscription.  If you do not have an existing Azure account, you may sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) or use your [Visual Studio Subscription](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/) benefits when you [create an account](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index).
- **Azure Application Insights Connection String:** To send telemetry data to the monitoring service you'll need connection string from Azure Application Insights. If you are not familiar with creating Azure resources, you may wish to follow the step-by-step guide for [Create an Application Insights resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource) and [copy the connection string](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string?tabs=net#finding-my-connection-string).

### Install the package

Install the Azure Monitor Exporter for OpenTelemetry .NET with NuGet:

```shell
dotnet add package Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Exporter
```
### Authenticate the client

Exporter does not use authentication. 

## Key concepts

This exporter sends traces to the configured Azure Monitor Resource using HTTPS. IP addresses used by the Azure Monitor is documented in [IP addresses used by Application Insights and Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/ip-addresses#outgoing-ports).

## Examples

Refer to [`DemoTrace.cs`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/monitor/Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Exporter/tests/Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Demo.Tracing/DemoTrace.cs) for a complete demo.

```csharp
using Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

OpenTelemetry.Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
    .AddSource("Demo.DemoClient")
    .AddAzureMonitorTraceExporter(o => {
        o.ConnectionString = "<Your Connection String>";
    })
    .Build();
```

## Troubleshooting

This exporter logs event using the .NET EventSource to emit information. The exporter logs are available to any EventListener by opting into the source named "OpenTelemetry-TraceExporter-AzureMonitor".

## Release Schedule

This exporter is under active development.

The library is not yet _generally available_, and is not officially supported. Future releases will not attempt to maintain backwards compatibility with previous releases. Each beta release includes significant changes to the exporter package, making them incompatible with each other.
