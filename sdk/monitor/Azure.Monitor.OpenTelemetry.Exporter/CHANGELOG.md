# Release History

## 1.1.0 (2023-11-29)

### Features Added

* Added NET6 target framework to support Trimming.
  ([#38459](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/pull/38459))
* Added support for Trimming and AOT.
  ([#38459](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/pull/38459))

### Bugs Fixed

* Fixed an issue where `OriginalFormat` persisted in TraceTelemetry properties
  with IncludeFormattedMessage set to true on [
  OpenTelemetryLoggerOptions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry/Logs/ILogger/OpenTelemetryLoggerOptions.cs)
  of the OpenTelemetry LoggerProvider. This fix prevents data duplication in
  message fields and properties.
  ([#39308](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/pull/39308))
  
* Fixed an issue related to the processing of scopes that do not conform to a
  key-value pair structure.
  ([#39453](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/pull/39453))
   * **Previous Behavior**: Logging a scope with a statement like
     `logger.BeginScope("SomeScopeValue")` would result in adding
     'SomeScopeValue' to the properties using a key that follows the pattern
     'scope->*'. Additionally, 'OriginalFormatScope_*' keys were used to handle
     formatted strings within the scope.
   * **New Behavior**: 
     * Non-key-value pair scopes are no longer added to the properties,
       resulting in cleaner and more efficient log output.
     * 'OriginalFormatScope_*' keys have been removed.
     * In case of duplicate keys within the scopes, only the first entry is
     retained, while all subsequent duplicate entries are discarded.

* Resolved an issue where activity tags of various object types, including
  double, float, and others, were previously formatted using
  `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture`. This behavior caused inconsistencies in tag
  value formatting depending on the regional settings of the machine where the
  application was running. Such inconsistencies could lead to challenges in data
  analysis and cause test failures in environments with differing cultural
  settings. The fix ensures uniform and culture-independent formatting of
  activity tag values, aligning with consistent data representation.
  ([#39470](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/39470))

## 1.0.0 (2023-09-20)

* Removing `ServiceVersion.V2020_09_15_Preview`. This is no longer in use and
  the exporter has already defaulted to the latest `ServiceVersion.v2_1`.
  ([#37996](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/pull/37996))
* Remove Nullable Annotations from the Exporter's public API.
