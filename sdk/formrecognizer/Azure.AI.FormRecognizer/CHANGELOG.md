- Property `CreatedOn` in types `CustomFormModel` and `CustomFormModelInfo` renamed to `RequestedOn`.
- Property `LastModified` in types `CustomFormModel` and `CustomFormModelInfo` renamed to `CompletedOn`.
- Property `Models` in `CustomFormModel` renamed to `Submodels`.
- Type `CustomFormSubModel` renamed to `CustomFormSubmodel`.

- Parameter `trainingFiles` in `FormTrainingClient.StartTraining` renamed to `trainingFilesUri`.
- Parameter `filter` in `FormTrainingClient.StartTraining` renamed to `trainingFileFilter`.
- Removed `Type` suffix from all `FieldValueType` values.
- Parameters `formFileStream` and `formFileUri` in `StartRecognizeContent` have been renamed to `form` and `formUrl` respectively.
- Parameters `receiptFileStream` and `receiptFileUri` in `StartRecognizeReceipts` have been renamed to `receipt` and `receiptUrl` respectively.

### Other breaking changes

- `FormPageRange` is now a `struct`.
- `RecognizeContentOperation` now returns a `FormPageCollection`.
- `RecognizeReceiptsOperation` now returns a `RecognizedReceiptCollection`.
- `RecognizeCustomFormsOperation` now returns a `RecognizedFormCollection`.
- In preparation for service-side changes, `FieldValue.AsInt32` has been replaced by `FieldValue.AsInt64`, which returns a `long`.
- Parameter `useTrainingLabels` is now required for `FormTrainingClient.StartTraining`.
- Protected constructors have been removed from `Operation` types, such as `TrainingOperation` or `RecognizeContentOperation`.
- `USReceipt`, `USReceiptItem`, `USReceiptType` and `FormField{T}` types removed. Information about a `RecognizedReceipt` must now be extracted from its `RecognizedForm`.
- `ReceiptLocale` removed from `RecognizedReceipt`.
- An `InvalidOperationException` is now raised if trying to access the `Value` property of a `TrainingOperation` when a trained model is invalid.
- A `RequestFailedException` is now raised if a model with `status=="invalid"` is returned from the `StartTraining` and `StartTrainingAsync` methods.
- A `RequestFailedException` is now raised if an operation like `StartRecognizeReceipts` or `StartRecognizeContent` fails.
- An `InvalidOperationException` is now raised if trying to access the `Value` property of a `xxOperation` object when the executed operation failed.
- Method `GetFormTrainingClient` has been removed from `FormRecognizerClient` and `GetFormRecognizerClient` has been added to `FormTrainingClient`.

### New Features

- `FormRecognizerClient` and `FormTrainingClient` support authentication with Azure Active Directory.
- Support to copy a custom model from one Form Recognizer resource to another.
- Headers and query parameters that were marked as `REDACTED` in error messages and logs are now exposed by default.

### Fixes

- Custom form recognition without labels can now handle multipaged forms ([#11881](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/11881)).
- `RecognizedForm.Pages` now only contains pages whose numbers are within `RecognizedForm.PageRange`.
- `FieldText.TextContent` cannot be `null` anymore, and it will be empty when no element is returned from the service.
- Custom form recognition with labels can now parse results from forms that do not contain all of the expected labels ([#11821](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/11821)).
- `FormRecognizerClient.StartRecognizeCustomFormsFromUri` now works with URIs that contain blank spaces, encoded or not ([#11564](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/11564)).
- Receipt recognition can now parse results from forms that contain blank pages.

## 1.0.0-preview.2 (05-06-2020)

### Fixes

- All of `FormRecognizerClient`'s `FormRecognizerClientOptions` are now passed to the client returned by
    `FormRecognizerClient.GetFormTrainingClient`.

## 1.0.0-preview.1 (04-23-2020)
This is the first preview Azure Form Recognizer client library that follows the [.NET Azure SDK Design Guidelines][guidelines].
This library replaces the package [`Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.FormRecognizer`][cognitiveServices_fr_nuget].

This package's [documentation][readme] and [samples][samples] demonstrate the new API.

### Major changes from `Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.FormRecognizer`
- This library supports only the Form Recognizer Service v2.0-preview API
- The namespace/package name for Azure Form Recognizer client library has changed from 
    `Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.FormRecognizer` to `Azure.AI.FormRecognizer`
- Two client design:
  - `FormRecognizerClient` to recognize and extract fields/values on custom forms, receipts, and form content/layout.
  - `FormTrainingClient` to train custom models, and manage the custom models on your resource account.
- Different recognize methods based on input type: file stream or URI.
- File stream methods will automatically detect content-type of the input file.
