# Azure Form Recognizer client SDK Samples
Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer is a cloud service that uses machine learning to recognize form fields, text, and tables in form documents. It includes the following capabilities:

- Layout - Extract text, table structures, and selection marks, along with their bounding region coordinates, from documents.
- Document - Analyze entities, key-value pairs, tables, and selection marks from documents using the general prebuilt document model.
- Prebuilt - Analyze data from certain types of common documents (such as receipts, invoices, business cards, or identity documents) using pre-trained models.
- Custom - Build custom models to analyze text, field values, selection marks, and table data from documents. Custom models are trained with your own data, so they're tailored to your documents.
