# Azure Form Recognizer client SDK Samples
Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer is a cloud service that uses machine learning to recognize form fields, text, and tables in form documents. It includes the following capabilities:

- Recognize form content - Recognize and extract tables, lines, and words in forms documents, without the need to train a model.
- Recognize custom forms - Recognize and extract form fields and other content from your custom forms, using models you trained with your own form types.
- Recognize receipts - Recognize and extract common fields from US receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model.

You can find samples for each of the main functions below.
