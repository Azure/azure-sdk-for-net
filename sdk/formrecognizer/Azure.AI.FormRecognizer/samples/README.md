# Azure Form Recognizer client SDK Samples
Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer is a cloud service that uses machine learning to recognize form fields, text, and tables in form documents. It includes the following capabilities:

- Recognize form content - Recognize and extract tables, lines, and words in forms documents, without the need to train a model.
- Recognize receipts - Recognize and extract common fields from US receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model.
- Recognize custom forms - Recognize and extract form fields and other content from your custom forms, using models you trained with your own form types.

You can find samples for each of the main functions below.
