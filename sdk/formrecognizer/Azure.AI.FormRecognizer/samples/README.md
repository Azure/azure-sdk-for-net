# Azure Form Recognizer client SDK Samples
Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer is a cloud service that uses machine learning to recognize form fields, text, and tables in form documents. It includes the following capabilities:

- Recognize form content - Recognize and extract tables, lines, words, and selection marks like radio buttons and check boxes in forms documents, without the need to train a model.
- Recognize custom forms - Recognize and extract form fields and other content from your custom forms, using models you trained with your own form types.
- Recognize receipts - Recognize and extract common fields from receipts, using a pre-trained receipt model.
- Recognize business cards - Recognize and extract common fields from business cards, using a pre-trained business cards model.
