# Azure Form Recognizer client SDK Samples
> Note: Starting with version `4.0.0`, a new set of clients were introduced to leverage the newest features of the Form Recognizer service. Please see the [Migration Guide][migration_guide] for detailed instructions on how to update application code from client library version `3.1.X` or lower to the latest version. Additionally, see the [Changelog][changelog] for more detailed information.

Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer is a cloud service that uses machine learning to analyze text and structured data from your documents. It includes the following main features:

- Layout - Extract text, selection marks, table structures, styles, and paragraphs, along with their bounding region coordinates from documents.
- General document - Analyze key-value pairs in addition to general layout from documents.
- Read - Read information about textual elements, such as page words and lines in addition to text language information.
- Prebuilt - Analyze data from certain types of common documents using prebuilt models. Supported documents include receipts, invoices, business cards, identity documents, vaccination cards, US W2 tax forms, and US health insurance cards.
- Custom - Build custom models to analyze text, field values, selection marks, table structures, styles, and paragraphs from documents. Custom models are built with your own data, so they're tailored to your documents.
