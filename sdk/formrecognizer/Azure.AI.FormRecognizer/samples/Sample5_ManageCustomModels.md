# Manage custom models

This sample demonstrates how to manage the custom models stored in your account.

To get started you'll need a Cognitive Services resource or a Form Recognizer resource.  See [README][README] for prerequisites and instructions.

## Creating a `FormTrainingClient`

To create a new `FormTrainingClient` you need the endpoint and credentials from your resource. In the sample below you'll use a Form Recognizer API key credential by creating an `AzureKeyCredential` object, that if needed, will allow you to update the API key without creating a new client.

You can set `endpoint` and `apiKey` based on an environment variable, a configuration setting, or any way that works for your application.

```C# Snippet:CreateFormTrainingClient
string endpoint = "<endpoint>";
string apiKey = "<apiKey>";
var credential = new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey);
var client = new FormTrainingClient(new Uri(endpoint), credential);
```

## Operations

Operations that can be executed are:
- Check the number of models in the FormRecognizer resource account, and the maximum number of models that can be stored there.
- List the models currently stored in the resource account.
- Get a specific model using the model's Id.
- Delete a model from the resource account.

```C# Snippet:FormRecognizerSample6ManageCustomModels
FormTrainingClient client = new FormTrainingClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey));

// Check number of models in the FormRecognizer account, and the maximum number of models that can be stored.
AccountProperties accountProperties = client.GetAccountProperties();
Console.WriteLine($"Account has {accountProperties.CustomModelCount} models.");
Console.WriteLine($"It can have at most {accountProperties.CustomModelLimit} models.");

// List the first ten or fewer models currently stored in the account.
Pageable<CustomFormModelInfo> models = client.GetCustomModels();

foreach (CustomFormModelInfo modelInfo in models.Take(10))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Custom Model Info:");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Model Id: {modelInfo.ModelId}");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Model Status: {modelInfo.Status}");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Requested on: {modelInfo.RequestedOn}");
    Console.WriteLine($"    Completed on: {modelInfo.CompletedOn}");
}

// Create a new model to store in the account
CustomFormModel model = await client.StartTrainingAsync(new Uri(trainingFileUrl), useTrainingLabels: false).WaitForCompletionAsync();

// Get the model that was just created
CustomFormModel modelCopy = client.GetCustomModel(model.ModelId);

Console.WriteLine($"Custom Model {modelCopy.ModelId} recognizes the following form types:");

foreach (CustomFormSubmodel submodel in modelCopy.Submodels)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Submodel Form Type: {submodel.FormType}");
    foreach (CustomFormModelField field in submodel.Fields.Values)
    {
        Console.Write($"    FieldName: {field.Name}");
        if (field.Label != null)
        {
            Console.Write($", FieldLabel: {field.Label}");
        }
        Console.WriteLine("");
    }
}

// Delete the model from the account.
client.DeleteModel(model.ModelId);
```
