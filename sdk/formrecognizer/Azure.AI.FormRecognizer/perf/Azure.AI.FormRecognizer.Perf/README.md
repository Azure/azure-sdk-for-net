# Azure Form Recognizer performance tests

The assets in this area comprise a set of performance tests for the [Azure Form Recognizer client library for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/formrecognizer/Azure.AI.FormRecognizer) and its associated ecosystem. The artifacts in this library are intended to be used primarily with the Azure SDK engineering system's testing infrastructure, but may also be run as stand-alone applications from the command line.

## Running performance tests

Run the Form Recognizer client library performance tests by executing the command-line application using the `dotnet run` command or, in some environments, your operating system's executable support. The performance tests rely on the same set of environment variables used by the Form Recognizer client library's test suite.
