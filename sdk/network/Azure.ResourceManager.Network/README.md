# Microsoft Azure Networking management client library for .NET

The networking services in Microsoft Azure provide a variety of networking capabilities that can be used together or separately. Key capabilities are:

- Connectivity services: Connect Azure resources and on-premises resources using any or a combination of these networking services in Azure - Virtual Network (VNet), Virtual WAN, ExpressRoute, VPN Gateway, Virtual network NAT Gateway, Azure DNS, Peering service, and Azure Bastion.
- Application protection services: Protect your applications using any or a combination of these networking services in Azure - Load Balancer, Private Link, DDoS protection, Firewall, - Network Security Groups, Web Application Firewall, and Virtual Network Endpoints.
- Application delivery services: Deliver applications in the Azure network using any or a combination of these networking services in Azure - Content Delivery Network (CDN), Azure Front Door Service, Traffic Manager, Application Gateway, Internet Analyzer, and Load Balancer.
- Network monitoring: Monitor your network resources using any or a combination of these networking services in Azure - Network Watcher, ExpressRoute Monitor, Azure Monitor, or VNet Terminal Access Point (TAP).

This library supports managing Microsoft Azure Networking resources.

This library follows the [new Azure SDK guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html), and provides many core capabilities:

    - Support MSAL.NET, Azure.Identity is out of box for supporting MSAL.NET.
    - Support [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for distributed tracing.
    - HTTP pipeline with custom policies.
    - Better error-handling.
    - Support uniform telemetry across all languages.
