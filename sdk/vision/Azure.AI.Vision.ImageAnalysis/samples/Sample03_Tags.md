# Azure AI Vision ImageAnalysis Tags client library for .NET

The Azure AI Vision ImageAnalysis Tags feature extracts content tags for thousands of recognizable objects, living beings, scenery, and actions that appear in images. It can provide additional context about the image content and can be used for searching, filtering, and organizing images based on their content. This library offers an easy way to extract tags from images using the Azure Computer Vision service.

Use the ImageAnalysis client library to:

- Authenticate against the ImageAnalysis service
- Upload an image for analysis
- Get the extracted tags

[Product documentation][image_analysis_overview] | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/rhurey/ia_initial/sdk/vision/Azure.AI.Vision.ImageAnalysis/samples) | [API reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.ai.vision.imageanalysis) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.Vision.ImageAnalysis/) | [SDK source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/vision/Azure.AI.Vision.ImageAnalysis)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
* An existing Azure Computer Vision resource. If you need to create an Azure Computer Vision resource, you can use the Azure Portal, [Azure CLI][azure_cli], or another Azure Resource Management client library.

### Install the package

Install the Azure AI Vision ImageAnalysis client library for .NET with [NuGet][nuget]:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Vision.ImageAnalysis
```
### Authenticate the client

In order to interact with Azure Image Analysis, you'll need to create an instance of the [ImageAnalysisClient][imageanalysis_client_class]
class. To configure a client for use with Azure Image Analysis, provide a valid endpoint URI to an Azure Computer Vision resource
along with a corresponding key credential authorized to use the Azure Computer Vison resource.

```C# Snippet:ImageAnalysisAuth
string endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("VISION_ENDPOINT");
string key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("VISION_KEY");

// Create an Image Analysis client.
ImageAnalysisClient client = new ImageAnalysisClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));
```

Here we are using environment variables to hold the endpoint and key for the Computer Vision Resource.

## Key concepts

### ImageAnalysisClient

An `ImageAnalysisClient` provides both synchronous and asynchronous operations in the SDK, allowing for the selection of a client based on an application's use case. Once you've initialized an `ImageAnalysisClient`, you can interact with the Tags feature in Azure AI Vision ImageAnalysis.

### TagsResult

A `TagsResult` is the result of the tag analysis. It contains a list of detected tags along with their confidence scores in the range [0, 1]. The higher the confidence score, the more accurate the detected tag is likely to be.

## Examples

The following sections provide code snippets using the `client` created above, covering using ImageAnalysis to extract tags from an image:

### Extract tags from an image file

This example demonstrates how to extract tags for the image file [sample.jpg](https://aka.ms/azai/vision/image-analysis-sample.jpg) using the `ImageAnalysisClient`. The synchronous `Analyze` method call returns an `ImageAnalysisResult` object, which contains the extracted tags and their confidence scores in the range [0, 1].

```C# Snippet:ImageAnalysisTagsFromFile
// Use a file stream to pass the image data to the analyze call
using FileStream stream = new FileStream("image-analysis-sample.jpg", FileMode.Open);

// Get the tags for the image. This will be a synchronously (blocking) call.
ImageAnalysisResult result = client.Analyze(
    BinaryData.FromStream(stream),
    VisualFeatures.Tags);

// Print tags results to the console
Console.WriteLine($"Image analysis results:");
Console.WriteLine($" Tags:");
foreach (DetectedTag tag in result.Tags.Values)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"   '{tag.Name}', Confidence {tag.Confidence:F4}");
}
```

### Extract tags from an image URL

This example is similar to the above, except it calls the `Analyze` method and provides a [publicly accessible image URL](https://aka.ms/azai/vision/image-analysis-sample.jpg) instead of a file name.

```C# Snippet:ImageAnalysisTagsFromUrl
// Get the tags for the image. This will be a synchronously (blocking) call.
ImageAnalysisResult result = client.Analyze(
    new Uri("https://aka.ms/azai/vision/image-analysis-sample.jpg"),
    VisualFeatures.Tags);

// Print tags results to the console
Console.WriteLine($"Image analysis results:");
Console.WriteLine($" Tags:");
foreach (DetectedTag tag in result.Tags.Values)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"   '{tag.Name}', Confidence {tag.Confidence:F4}");
}
```

## Troubleshooting

See our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/rhurey/ia_initial/sdk/vision/Azure.AI.Vision.ImageAnalysis/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios.

### General

When you interact with the Azure Computer Vision service using the .NET SDK, errors returned by the service correspond to the same HTTP status codes returned for [REST API][keyvault_rest] requests.

For example, if you try to analyze an image that is not accessible due to a broken URL, a `400` error is returned, indicating a bad request.

### Handling exceptions

In the following snippet, the error is handled gracefully by catching the exception and displaying additional information about the error.

```C# Snippet:ImageAnalysisTagsException
var imageUrl = new Uri("https://aka.ms.invalid/azai/vision/image-analysis-sample.jpg");

try
{
    var result = client.Analyze(imageUrl, VisualFeatures.DenseCaptions);
}
catch (RequestFailedException e)
{
    if (e.Status == 400)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error analyzing image.");
        Console.WriteLine("HTTP status code 400: The request is invalid or malformed.");
    }
    else
    {
        throw;
    }
}
```

You will notice that additional information is logged, like the Client Request ID of the operation.
