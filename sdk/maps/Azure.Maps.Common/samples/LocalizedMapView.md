# LocalizedMapView

`LocalizedMapView` is a enum-like struct user can assign localized map view for geo-political concern. The possible example looks like:

```C# Snippet:LocalizedMapViewUsage
var unifiedView = new LocalizedMapView("Unified");
var autoView = new LocalizedMapView("auto");
var unitedArabEmirates = new LocalizedMapView("AE");
```
