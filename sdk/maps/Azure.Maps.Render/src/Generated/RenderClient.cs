        /// There is a built in pushpin style called &apos;none&apos; that does not display a pushpin image. You can use this if

        /// `pins=none||&apos;A&apos;-122 45|&apos;B&apos;-119.5 43.2`
        /// 
        /// To change the color of the pushpin labels, use the &apos;lc&apos; label color style modifier. For example, to use pink
        /// pushpins with black labels, use
        /// 
        /// `pins=default|coFF1493|lc000000||-122 45`
        /// 
        /// To change the size of the labels, use the &apos;ls&apos; label size style modifier. The label size represents the approximate
        /// height of the label text in pixels. For example, to increase the label size to 12, use
        /// 
        /// `pins=default|ls12||&apos;A&apos;-122 45|&apos;B&apos;-119 43`

        /// and provide X and Y pixel coordinates for the anchor. These coordinates are relative to the top left corner of the
        /// pushpin image. Positive X values move the anchor to the right, and positive Y values move the anchor down. For example,
        /// to position the label anchor 10 pixels right and 4 pixels above the top left corner of the pushpin image,

        /// 
        /// `pins=default|la10 -4||&apos;A&apos;-122 45|&apos;B&apos;-119 43`

        /// ### Custom Pushpins
        /// 
        /// To use a custom pushpin image, use the word &apos;custom&apos; as the pin style name, and then specify a URL after the
        /// location and label information. Use two pipe characters to indicate that you&apos;re done specifying locations and are
        /// starting the URL. For example,
        /// 
        /// `pins=custom||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`

        /// 
        /// By default, custom pushpin images are drawn centered at the pin coordinates. This usually isn&apos;t ideal as it obscures
        /// the location that you&apos;re trying to highlight. To override the anchor location of the pin image, use the &apos;an&apos;
        /// style modifier. This uses the same format as the &apos;la&apos; label anchor style modifier. For example, if your custom
        /// pin image has the tip of the pin at the top left corner of the image, you can set the anchor to that spot by
        /// using
        /// 
        /// `pins=custom|an0 0||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`
        ///

        /// ### Custom Pushpins
        /// 
        /// To use a custom pushpin image, use the word &apos;custom&apos; as the pin style name, and then specify a URL after the
        /// location and label information. Use two pipe characters to indicate that you&apos;re done specifying locations and are
        /// starting the URL. For example,
        /// 
        /// `pins=custom||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`
        /// 
        /// After URL encoding, this would look like
        /// 
        /// `pins=custom%7C%7C-122+45%7C%7Chttp%3A%2F%2Fcontoso.com%2Fpushpins%2Fred.png`
        /// 
        /// By default, custom pushpin images are drawn centered at the pin coordinates. This usually isn&apos;t ideal as it obscures
        /// the location that you&apos;re trying to highlight. To override the anchor location of the pin image, use the &apos;an&apos;
        /// style modifier. This uses the same format as the &apos;la&apos; label anchor style modifier. For example, if your custom
        /// pin image has the tip of the pin at the top left corner of the image, you can set the anchor to that spot by
        /// using
        /// 
        /// `pins=custom|an0 0||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`
        /// 
        /// Note: If you use the &apos;co&apos; color modifier with a custom pushpin image, the specified color will replace the RGB
        /// channels of the pixels in the image but will leave the alpha (opacity) channel unchanged. This would usually
        /// only be done with a solid-color custom image.
        /// 
        /// ### Getting Pushpins from Azure Maps Data Storage
        /// 
        /// For all Azure Maps account SKUs other than S0,
        /// the pushpin image and location information can be obtained from Azure Maps Data Storage. After uploading a pushpin image
        /// or a GeoJSON document containing pin locations, the Data Storage service returns a Unique Data ID (UDID) that you can use
        /// to reference the data in the pins parameter.
        /// 
        /// To use a custom pushpin image from Azure Maps Data Storage, specify the UDID prefixed by &apos;udid-&apos; as the name of the
        /// pushpin style. For example,
        /// 
        /// `pins=udid-fe22c504-3a81-4fcd-adc6-a3507ce866c1||-122 45`
        /// 
        /// To use the point geometry from an uploaded GeoJSON document as the pin locations, specify the UDID in the locations
        /// section of the pins parameter. For example,
        /// 
        /// `pins=default||udid-29dc105a-dee7-409f-a3f9-22b066ae4713`
        /// 
        /// Note that
        /// only point and multipoint geometry, points and multipoints from geometry collections, and point geometry from features
        /// will be used. Linestring and polygon geometry will be ignored. If the point comes from a feature and the feature
        /// has a string property called &quot;label&quot;, the value of that property will be used as the label for the pin.
        /// 
        /// You can mix pin locations from Data Storage and pin locations specified in the pins parameter. Any of the pipe-delimited
        /// pin locations can be a longitude and latitude or a UDID. For example,
        /// 
        /// `pins=default||-122 45|udid-29dc105a-dee7-409f-a3f9-22b066ae4713|-119 43`
        /// 
        /// ### Scale, Rotation, and Opacity
        /// 
        /// You can make pushpins and their labels larger or smaller by using the &apos;sc&apos; scale style modifier. This is a
        /// value greater than zero. A value of 1 is the standard scale. Values larger than 1 will make the pins larger, and
        /// values smaller than 1 will make them smaller. For example, to draw the pushpins 50% larger than normal, use
        /// 
        /// `pins=default|sc1.5||-122 45`
        /// 
        /// You can rotate pushpins and their labels by using the &apos;ro&apos; rotation style modifier. This is a number of degrees
        /// of clockwise rotation. Use a negative number to rotate counter-clockwise. For example, to rotate the pushpins
        /// 90 degrees clockwise and double their size, use
        /// 
        /// `pins=default|ro90|sc2||-122 45`
        /// 
        /// You can make pushpins and their labels partially transparent by specifying the &apos;al&apos; alpha style modifier.
        /// This is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the opacity of the pushpins. Zero makes them completely transparent
        /// (and not visible) and 1 makes them completely opaque (which is the default). For example, to make pushpins
        /// and their labels only 67% opaque, use
        /// 
        /// `pins=default|al.67||-122 45`
