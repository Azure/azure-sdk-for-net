            /// `pins=default||'1'-122 45|'2'-119.5 43.2|'3'-121.67 47.12`
            ///
            /// There is a built in pushpin style called 'none' that does not display a
            /// pushpin image. You can use this if
            /// you want to display labels without any pin image. For example,
            ///
            /// `pins=none||'A'-122 45|'B'-119.5 43.2`
            ///
            /// To change the color of the pushpin labels, use the 'lc' label color style
            /// modifier. For example, to use pink
            /// pushpins with black labels, use
            ///
            /// `pins=default|coFF1493|lc000000||-122 45`
            ///
            /// To change the size of the labels, use the 'ls' label size style modifier.
            /// The label size represents the approximate
            /// height of the label text in pixels. For example, to increase the label size
            /// to 12, use
            ///
            /// `pins=default|ls12||'A'-122 45|'B'-119 43`
            ///
            /// The labels are centered at the pushpin 'label anchor.' The anchor location
            /// is predefined for built-in pushpins and
            /// is at the top center of custom pushpins (see below). To override the label
            /// anchor, using the 'la' style modifier
            /// and provide X and Y pixel coordinates for the anchor. These coordinates are
            /// relative to the top left corner of the
            /// pushpin image. Positive X values move the anchor to the right, and positive
            /// Y values move the anchor down. For example,
            /// to position the label anchor 10 pixels right and 4 pixels above the top
            /// left corner of the pushpin image,
            /// use
            ///
            /// `pins=default|la10 -4||'A'-122 45|'B'-119 43`
            ///
            /// ### Custom Pushpins
            ///
            /// To use a custom pushpin image, use the word 'custom' as the pin style name,
            /// and then specify a URL after the
            /// location and label information. Use two pipe characters to indicate that
            /// you're done specifying locations and are
            /// starting the URL. For example,
            ///
            /// `pins=custom||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`
            ///
            /// After URL encoding, this would look like

            /// `pins=custom%7C%7C-122+45%7C%7Chttp%3A%2F%2Fcontoso.com%2Fpushpins%2Fred.png`
            ///
            /// By default, custom pushpin images are drawn centered at the pin
            /// coordinates. This usually isn't ideal as it obscures
            /// the location that you're trying to highlight. To override the anchor
            /// location of the pin image, use the 'an'
            /// style modifier. This uses the same format as the 'la' label anchor style
            /// modifier. For example, if your custom
            /// pin image has the tip of the pin at the top left corner of the image, you
            /// can set the anchor to that spot by
            /// using
            ///
            /// `pins=custom|an0 0||-122 45||http://contoso.com/pushpins/red.png`
            ///
            /// Note: If you use the 'co' color modifier with a custom pushpin image, the
            /// specified color will replace the RGB
            /// channels of the pixels in the image but will leave the alpha (opacity)
            /// channel unchanged. This would usually
            /// only be done with a solid-color custom image.
