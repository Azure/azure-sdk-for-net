# Azure Maps Search client library for .NET

Azure Maps Search is a library that can query for locations, points of interests or search within a geometric area.

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/maps/Azure.Maps.Search/src) | [API reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/) | [REST API reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search) | [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/)

## Getting started

### Install the package

Install the client library for .NET with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/ ):

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Maps.Search --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites

> You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) and [Azure Maps account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/quick-demo-map-app#create-an-azure-maps-account).

To create a new Azure Maps account, you can use the Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure CLI. Here's an example using the Azure CLI:

```powershell
az maps account create --kind "Gen2" --disable-local-auth true --account-name "myMapAccountName" --resource-group "<resource group>" --sku "G2" --accept-tos
```

### Authenticate the client

There are 2 ways to authenticate the client: Shared key authentication and Azure AD.

#### Shared Key Authentication

* Go to Azure Maps account > Authentication tab
* Copy `Primary Key` or `Secondary Key` under **Shared Key Authentication** section

```C# Snippet:InstantiateSearchClientViaSubscriptionKey
// Create a SearchClient that will authenticate through Subscription Key (Shared key)
var credential = new AzureKeyCredential("<My Subscription Key>");
MapsSearchClient client = new MapsSearchClient(credential);
```

#### Azure AD Authentication

In order to interact with the Azure Maps service, you'll need to create an instance of the MapsSearchClient class. The Azure Identity library makes it easy to add Azure Active Directory support for authenticating Azure SDK clients with their corresponding Azure services.

To use AAD authentication, set `TENANT_ID`, `CLIENT_ID`, and `CLIENT_SECRET` to environment variable and call `DefaultAzureCredential()` method to get credential. `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` are the service principal ID and secret that can access Azure Maps account.

We also need **Azure Maps Client ID** which can get from Azure Maps page > Authentication tab > "Client ID" in Azure Active Directory Authentication section.

```C# Snippet:InstantiateSearchClientViaAAD
// Create a MapsSearchClient that will authenticate through AAD
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var clientId = "<My Map Account Client Id>";
MapsSearchClient client = new MapsSearchClient(credential, clientId);
```

## Key concepts

`MapsSearchClient` is designed to:

* Communicate with Azure Maps endpoint to query addresses or points of locations
* Communicate with Azure Maps endpoint to request the geometry data such as a city or country outline for a set of entities
* Communicate with Azure Maps endpoint to perform a free form search inside a single geometry or many of them

### Thread safety

We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples

You can familiarize yourself with different APIs using our [samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/maps/Azure.Maps.Search/tests/Samples).

### Example Get Polygons

```C# Snippet:GetPolygons
// Get Addresses
var searchResult = await client.SearchAddressAsync("Seattle");

// Extract geometry ids from addresses
var geometry0Id = searchResult.Value.Results.First().DataSources.Geometry.Id;
var geometry1Id = searchResult.Value.Results[1].DataSources.Geometry.Id;

// Extract position coordinates
var positionCoordinates = searchResult.Value.Results.First().Position;

// Get polygons from geometry ids
PolygonResult polygonResponse = await client.GetPolygonsAsync(new[] { geometry0Id, geometry1Id });
```

### Example Fuzzy Search
```C# Snippet:FuzzySearch
var fuzzySearchResponse = await client.FuzzySearchAsync("coffee", new FuzzySearchOptions {
    Coordinates = new GeoPosition(121.56, 25.04),
    Language = "en"
});
```

### Example Reverse Search Cross Street Address
```C# Snippet:ReverseSearchCrossStreetAddress
var reverseResult = await client.ReverseSearchCrossStreetAddressAsync(new ReverseSearchCrossStreetOptions {
    coordinates = new GeoPosition(121.0, 24.0),
    Language = "en"
});
```

### Example Search Structured Address
```C# Snippet:SearchStructuredAddress
var address = new StructuredAddress {
    CountryCode = "US",
    StreetNumber = "15127",
    StreetName = "NE 24th Street",
    Municipality = "Redmond",
    CountrySubdivision = "WA",
    PostalCode = "98052"
};
var searchResult = await client.SearchStructuredAddressAsync(address);
```

### Example Search Inside Geometry
```C# Snippet:SearchInsideGeometry
var sfPolygon = new GeoPolygon(new[]
{
    new GeoPosition(-122.43576049804686, 37.752415234354402),
    new GeoPosition(-122.4330139160, 37.706604725423119),
    new GeoPosition(-122.36434936523438, 37.712059855877314),
    new GeoPosition(-122.43576049804686, 37.7524152343544)
});

var taipeiPolygon = new GeoPolygon(new[]
{
    new GeoPosition(121.56, 25.04),
    new GeoPosition(121.565, 25.04),
    new GeoPosition(121.565, 25.045),
    new GeoPosition(121.56, 25.045),
    new GeoPosition(121.56, 25.04)
});

var searchResponse = await client.SearchInsideGeometryAsync("coffee", new GeoCollection(new[] { sfPolygon, taipeiPolygon }), new SearchInsideGeometryOptions {
    Language = "en"
});
```

### Example Search Address
```C# Snippet:SearchAddress
var searchResult = await client.SearchAddressAsync("Seattle");
```

## Troubleshooting

### General

When you interact with the Azure Maps Services, errors returned by the Language service correspond to the same HTTP status codes returned for REST API requests.

For example, if you try to search with invalid coordinates, a error is returned, indicating "Bad Request".400
