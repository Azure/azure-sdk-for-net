# Azure IoT Hub client library for .NET

This library provides access to the Azure IoT Hub service for managing devices, modules, twins and jobs.

  [Source code][source] | [Package (nuget)][package]

## Getting started

The complete Microsoft Azure SDK can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Azure downloads][microsoft_sdk_download] page, and it ships with support for building deployment packages, integrating with tooling, rich command line tooling, and more.

For the best development experience, developers should use the official Microsoft NuGet packages for libraries. NuGet packages are regularly updated with new functionality and hotfixes.

### Install the package

### Prerequisites

- A Microsoft Azure Subscription
  - To call Microsoft Azure services, create an [Azure subscription][azure_sub].

### Authenticate the Client

## Key concepts

### Thread safety
We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.
