# Azure Confidential Ledger client library for .NET

Azure Confidential Ledger provides a service for logging to an immutable, tamper-proof ledger. As part of the [Azure Confidential Computing][azure_confidential_computing]
portfolio, Azure Confidential Ledger runs in SGX enclaves. It is built on Microsoft Research's [Confidential Consortium Framework][ccf].

  [Source code][client_src] | [Package (NuGet)][client_nuget_package] <!--| [API reference documentation][api_reference] | [Samples][samples] -->

## Getting started

This section should include everything a developer needs to do to install and create their first client connection *very quickly*.

### Install the package
Install the Confidential Ledger client library for .NET with [NuGet][client_nuget_package]:

```
dotnet add package Azure.Storage.ConfidentialLedger --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites
* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
* A running instance of Azure Confidential Ledger.
* A registered user in the Confidential Ledger with `Administrator` privileges.

### Authenticate the client

#### Using Azure Active Directory

This document demonstrates using [DefaultAzureCredential][default_cred_ref] to authenticate to the Confidential Ledger via Azure Active Directory.
However, `ConfidentialLedgerClient` accepts any [Azure.Identity][azure_identity] token credential. See the [Azure.Identity][azure_identity] documentation
for more information about other credentials.

#### Using a client certificate

As an alternative to Azure Active Directory, clients may choose to use a client certificate to authenticate via mutual TLS.

### Create a client
`DefaultAzureCredential` will automatically handle most Azure SDK client scenarios. To get started, set environment variables for the AAD identity registered with your Confidential Ledger.
```bash
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="generated app id"
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="random password"
export AZURE_TENANT_ID="tenant id"
```
Then, `DefaultAzureCredential` will be able to authenticate the `ConfidentialLedgerClient`.

Constructing the client also requires your Confidential Ledger's URL and id, which you can get from the Azure CLI or the Azure Portal. When you have retrieved those values, please replace instances of `"my-ledger-id"` and `"https://my-ledger-url.confidential-ledger.azure.com"` in the examples below

Because Confidential Ledgers use self-signed certificates securely generated and stored in an SGX enclave, the certificate for each Confidential Ledger must first be retrieved from the Confidential Ledger Identity Service.

## Key concepts
### Ledger entries
Every write to Confidential Ledger generates an immutable ledger entry in the service. Writes are uniquely identified by transaction ids that increment with each write.

TODO

Since Confidential Ledger is a distributed system, rare transient failures may cause writes to be lost. For entries that must be preserved, it is advisable to verify that the write became durable. Waits are blocking calls.

TODO

#### Receipts
State changes to the Confidential Ledger are saved in a data structure called a Merkle tree. To cryptographically verify that writes were correctly saved, a Merkle proof, or receipt, can be retrieved for any transaction id.

TODO

#### Sub-ledgers
While most use cases will involve one ledger, we provide the sub-ledger feature in case different logical groups of data need to be stored in the same Confidential Ledger.

TODO

When no sub-ledger id is specified on method calls, the Confidential Ledger service will assume a constant, service-determined sub-ledger id.

TODO

Ledger entries are retrieved from sub-ledgers. When a transaction id is specified, the returned value is the value contained in the specified sub-ledger at the point in time identified by the transaction id. If no transaction id is specified, the latest available value is returned.

TODO

##### Ranged queries
Ledger entries in a sub-ledger may be retrieved over a range of transaction ids.

TODO

### User management
Users are managed directly with the Confidential Ledger instead of through Azure. New users may be AAD-based or certificate-based.

TODO

#### Certificate-based users
Clients may authenticate with a client certificate in mutual TLS instead of via Azure Active Directory. `ConfidentialLedgerCertificateCredential` is provided for such clients.

TODO

### Confidential consortium and enclave verifications
One may want to validate details about the Confidential Ledger for a variety of reasons. For example, you may want to view details about how Microsoft may manage your Confidential Ledger as part of [Confidential Consortium Framework governance](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/index.html), or verify that your Confidential Ledger is indeed running in SGX enclaves. A number of client methods are provided for these use cases.

TODO

[Microsoft Azure Attestation Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-attestation/) is one provider of SGX enclave quotes.

### Async API
This library includes a complete async API supported on Python 3.5+. To use it, you must first install an async transport, such as [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp). See [azure-core documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md#transport) for more information.

Async clients should be closed when they're no longer needed. These objects are async context managers and define async `close` methods. For example:

### Thread safety

We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples

TODO

## Troubleshooting

Describe common errors and exceptions, how to "unpack" them if necessary, and include guidance for graceful handling and recovery.

Provide information to help developers avoid throttling or other service-enforced errors they might encounter. For example, provide guidance and examples for using retry or connection policies in the API.

If the package or a related package supports it, include tips for logging or enabling instrumentation to help them debug their code.

## Next steps

* Provide a link to additional code examples, ideally to those sitting alongside the README in the package's `/samples` directory.
* If appropriate, point users to other packages that might be useful.
* If you think there's a good chance that developers might stumble across your package in error (because they're searching for specific functionality and mistakenly think the package provides that functionality), point them to the packages they might be looking for.

## Contributing

This is a template, but your SDK readme should include details on how to contribute code to the repo/package.
