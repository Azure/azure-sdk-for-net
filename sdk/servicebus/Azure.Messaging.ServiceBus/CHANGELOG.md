# Release History

## 7.18.0-beta.1 (Unreleased)

### Features Added

### Breaking Changes

### Bugs Fixed

### Other Changes

## 7.17.1 (2023-12-04)

### Bugs Fixed

- Adjusted retries to consider an unreachable host address as terminal.  Previously, all socket-based errors were considered transient and would be retried.
- Updated the `ServiceBusMessage` constructor that takes a `ServiceBusReceivedMessage` to no longer copy over the 
  `x-opt-partition-id` key as this is meant to apply only to the original message.
- Drain excess credits when attempting to receive using sessions to ensure FIFO ordering.

### Other Changes

- Updated the `Microsoft.Azure.Amqp` dependency to 2.6.4, which enables support for TLS 1.3.
- Removed the custom sizes for the AMQP sending and receiving buffers, allowing the optimized defaults of the host platform to be used.  This offers non-trivial performance increase on Linux-based platforms and a minor improvement on macOS.  Windows performance remains unchanged as the default and custom buffer sizes are equivalent.

## 7.17.0 (2023-11-14)

### Breaking Changes

The following breaking changes were made for the experimental support of Open Telemetry:
- Change `ActivitySource` name used to report message activity from `Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus` to `Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.Message`.
- Updated tracing attributes names to conform to OpenTelemetry semantic conventions version 1.23.0.

## 7.16.2 (2023-10-11)

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed issue where `ActivitySource` activities were not being created even when the experimental 
  flag was set.

### Other Changes

- The reference for the AMQP transport library, `Microsoft.Azure.Amqp`, has been bumped to 2.6.3. This fixes an issue with timeout duration calculations during link creation and includes several efficiency improvements.

## 7.16.1 (2023-08-15)

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed race condition that could lead to an `ObjectDisposedException` when using the `ServiceBusSessionProcessor`.

## 7.16.0 (2023-08-07)

### Acknowledgments

- Daniel Marbach  _([GitHub](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

### Features Added

- `ProcessMessageEventArgs` provides a `MessageLockLostAsync` event that can be subscribed to in 
  order to be notified when the message lock is lost.
- `ProcessSessionMessageEventArgs` provides a `SessionLockLostAsync` event that can be subscribed to in
  order to be notified when the session lock is lost.
- A constructor for `ServiceBusMessage` taking an `AmqpAnnotatedMessage` has been added.

### Bugs Fixed

- The `CancellationTokenSource` used by the `ServiceBusSessionProcessor` in order to renew session 
  locks is now disposed when the session is no longer being processed, thereby preventing a memory leak.

## 7.15.0 (2023-06-06)

### Bugs Fixed

- Do not copy over `DeliveryAnnotations` when constructing a new `ServiceBusMessage` from a `ServiceBusReceivedMessage`.

### Other Changes

- The reference for the AMQP transport library, Microsoft.Azure.Amqp, has been bumped to 2.6.2. This resolves a potential issue opening TLS connections on .NET 6+.

## 7.14.0 (2023-05-09)

### Features Added

- The client-side idle timeout for connections can now be configured using `ServiceBusClientOptions`.

### Bugs Fixed

- Removed the 30 second cap applied when opening AMQP links; this allows developers to fully control the timeout for service operations by tuning the `TryTimeout` as appropriate for the application.

- Fixed potential `NullReferenceException` when using the `ServiceBusProcessor` or `ServiceBusSessionProcessor`.

## 7.13.1 (2023-03-13)

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed issue with Guid writing during message settlement that could result in an `ArgumentException` if the ArrayPool returned a buffer that is larger than the size of the Guid.

## 7.13.0 (2023-03-08)

### Acknowledgments

- Daniel Marbach  _([GitHub](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

### Features Added

- `ActivitySource` activities that are used when using the [experimental OpenTelemetry support](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/introducing-experimental-opentelemetry-support-in-the-azure-sdk-for-net/) will include the `az.schema_url` tag indicating the OpenTelemetry schema version. They will also include the messaging attribute specified [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk/blob/main/docs/tracing/distributed-tracing-conventions.yml#L98).

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed deserialization of the lock token to take into account endianness. _(A community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

### Other Changes

- Some checks for cancellation that were occurring after a service operation had been completed have been removed.  Because the service operation was already complete, cancellation was not actually performed and the results of the operation should be returned.

- Exceptions related to the cancellation token being signaled on a receive operation will now be logged as Verbose rather than Error.

## 7.12.0 (2023-01-12)

### Acknowledgments

### Other Changes

- Update AMQP library dependency to leverage new `DrainAsync` method.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed issue with `MaxConcurrentCallsPerSession` setting which resulted in the setting not always being respected.

## 7.11.1 (2022-11-08)

### Bugs Fixed

- Telemetry will now use a parent activity instead of links when using the `ServiceBusProcessor` or `ServiceBusSessionProcessor`.
- Attempt to drain the receiver when closing if there are outstanding credits.

## 7.11.0 (2022-10-11)

### Acknowledgments

- Dispose semaphores in `ServiceBusProcessor` to avoid memory leak. _(A community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

### Other Changes

- Optimized message body copying when accessing the `Body` property of a received message. _(A community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_
- Removed locking from the `ServiceBusRetryPolicy` to improve performance and prevent deadlocks. _(A community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_
- Added link to [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/servicebus/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) in exception messages.

## 7.11.0-beta.1 (2022-09-06)

### Features Added

- Added `DeadletterMessageAsync` overload that allows passing the properties dictionary in addition to the deadletter error reason and description.
- Added `PeekMessagesAsync` method to `ProcessorReceiveActions`.

### Breaking Changes

- Improved performance of sending messages by using the `ServiceBusMessageBatch` type, by caching the underlying AMQP message as opposed to recalculating it when sending. Because of this change, any changes to a `ServiceBusMessage` after it has already been added to the batch will no longer be reflected in the batch and what is ultimately sent to the service. To avoid any issues from this change, ensure that yo are not modifying the `ServiceBusMessage` after adding it to a batch.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed performance issues in the `ServiceBusSessionProcessor` that could lead to thread starvation when using a high number of concurrent sessions.
- Fixed diagnostic tracing of the `ServiceBusReceiver.Receive` operation to correctly include links to the `Message` operation for the received messages.
- Fixed issue where the TryTimeout was not respected for times over 1 minute and 5 seconds when attempting to accept the next available session.

### Other Changes

- Improved performance of sending messages by using the `ServiceBusMessageBatch` type, by caching the underlying AMQP message as opposed to recalculating it when sending.

## 7.10.0 (2022-08-11)

### Features Added

- Added the ability to set the a custom Identifier on the various client options types.
- The processor Identifier will now be included in the underlying receiver logs when using the `ServiceBusProcessor` or `ServiceBusSessionProcessor`.
- Added the ability to set a custom endpoint that will be used when connecting to the service, via the `ServiceBusClientOptions.CustomEndpointAddress` property.
- Added the `ReleaseSession` and `RenewSessionLockAsync` methods to the `ProcessSessionEventArgs` class to allow the user to manage the session in the `SessionInitializingAsync` and the `SessionClosingAsync` event handlers.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed issue where the AMQP footer would not be populated on received messages.
- Fixed issue where the client timeout was not respected when establishing the AMQP connection and the AMQP session.
- Fixed issue where closing the rule manager link could result in the AMQP session being closed even when `EnableCrossEntityTransactions` is set to `true` in the `ServiceBusClientOptions`.

### Other Changes

- Reduced memory allocations when converting messages into the underlying AMQP primitives. _(A community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

## 7.8.1 (2022-05-16)

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed issue that could result in the message lock renewal not being cancelled if the user message handler threw an exception.
- Abandon messages that are received from the `ProcessorReceiveActions` in the event of the user message handler throwing an exception.

## 7.8.0 (2022-05-09)

### Features Added

- Added the `GetReceiveActions` method to `ProcessMessageEventArgs` and `ProcessSessionMessageEventArgs` to allow for receiving additional messages from the processor callback.

### Breaking Changes

- `ServiceBusTransportMetrics` and `ServiceBusRuleManager` have been removed from the prior beta versions. These will be evaluated for inclusion in a future GA release.

### Bugs Fixed

- Prevent exception when stopping processor that can occur if custom registrations were added to the `CancellationToken` that is exposed via the event args.
- Don't close entire AMQP session when closing individual AMQP links when `EnableCrossEntityTransactions` is set to `true`, since with this configuration, all links will share the same session.

### Other Changes

- Retries related to accepting sessions when using the `ServiceBusSessionProcessor` are now logged as `Verbose` rather than `Warning`.

To retain the old behavior, you can set the properties to empty string when constructing your message:
```c#
var message = new ServiceBusMessage
{
    ReplyTo = "",

    CorrelationId = ""
};
```

### Bugs Fixed
