### Other Changes

## 7.2.1 (2021-07-07)

### Fixed

- The retry policy used by clients will no longer overflow the `TimeSpan` maximum when using an `Exponential` strategy with a large number of retries and long delay set.

## 7.2.0-beta.3 (2021-05-12)

### Added
* Added `SubQueue` option to `ServiceBusProcessorOptions` to allow for processing the deadletter queue

  * Accepting a session times out because there are no sessions available.
  * TaskCanceledException occurs while stopping the processor.

- Daniel Marbach _([GitHub](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_
- Mikael Kolkinn _([GitHub](https://github.com/mikaelkolkinn))_
