# Azure AI Projects client library for .NET
Use the AI Projects client library to:

* **Develop Agents using the Azure AI Agent Service**, leveraging an extensive ecosystem of models, tools, and capabilities from OpenAI, Microsoft, and other LLM providers. The Azure AI Agent Service enables the building of Agents for a wide range of generative AI use cases. The package is currently in preview.
* **Enumerate connections** in your Azure AI Foundry project and get connection properties. For example, get the inference endpoint URL and credentials associated with your Azure OpenAI connection.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

To use Azure AI Projects capabilities, you must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/). This will allow you to create an Azure AI resource and get a connection URL.

### Install the package

Install the client library for .NET with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/ ):

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Projects --prerelease
```

### Authenticate the client

A secure, keyless authentication approach is to use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) via the [Azure Identity library][azure_identity]. To use this library, you need to install the [Azure.Identity package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Identity):

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
```

## Key concepts

### Create and authenticate the client

To interact with Azure AI Projects, you’ll need to create an instance of `AIProjectClient`. Use the appropriate credential type from the Azure Identity library. For example, [DefaultAzureCredential][azure_identity_dac]:

```C# Snippet:OverviewCreateClient
var endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PROJECT_ENDPOINT");
AIProjectClient projectClient = new AIProjectClient(new Uri(endpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

Once the `AIProjectClient` is created, you can call methods in the form of `Get<Method>Client()` on this client to retrieve instances of specific sub-clients.

## Examples
<!-- TODO: add this later -->

## Troubleshooting

Any operation that fails will throw a [RequestFailedException][RequestFailedException]. The exception's `code` will hold the HTTP response status code. The exception's `message` contains a detailed message that may be helpful in diagnosing the issue:

```C# Snippet:Readme_Troubleshooting
try
{
    projectClient.GetDatasetsClient().GetDataset("non-existent-dataset-name", "non-existent-dataset-version");
}
catch (RequestFailedException ex) when (ex.Status == 404)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Exception status code: {ex.Status}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Exception message: {ex.Message}");
}
```

To further diagnose and troubleshoot issues, you can enable logging following the [Azure SDK logging documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/sdk/logging). This allows you to capture additional insights into request and response details, which can be particularly helpful when diagnosing complex issues.

## Next steps

Beyond the introductory scenarios discussed, the AI Projects client library offers support for additional scenarios to help take advantage of the full feature set of the AI services.  In order to help explore some of these scenarios, the AI Projects client library offers a set of samples to serve as an illustration for common scenarios.  Please see the [Samples][samples] for details.
