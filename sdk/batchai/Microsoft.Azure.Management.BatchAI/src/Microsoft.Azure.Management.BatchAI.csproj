        This version uses 2018-05-01 BatchAI API specification which introduced the following braking changes:
        1. Clusters, FileServers must be created under a workspace;
        2. Jobs must be created under an experiment;
        3. Clusters, FileServers and Jobs do not accept location during creation and belong to the same location as the parent workspace;
        4. Clusters, FileServers and Jobs do not support tags;
        5. BatchAIManagementClient.Usage renamed to BatchAIManagementClient.Usages;
        6. Job priority changed a type from int to an enum;
        7. File.IsDirectory is replaced with File.FileType;

        9. Removed unsupported MountSettings.FileServerType attribute;
        10. OutputDirectory.Type unsupported attribute removed;
