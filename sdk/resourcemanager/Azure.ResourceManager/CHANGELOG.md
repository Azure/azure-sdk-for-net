## 1.6.0 (2023-05-16)

### Features Added

- Add more model factory entries in class `Azure.ResourceManager.Models.ResourceManagerModelFactory` to support more generated models.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed [the issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/34796) that tag operations are not properly working.

## 1.5.0 (2023-04-27)

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed `ManagedServiceIdentity` deserialization when services return empty string for `principalId` or `tenantId`.

### Other Changes

- Bump api-version of `PolicyAssignments` to `2022-06-01`.
- Bump api-version of `PolicyDefinitions` and `PolicySetDefinitions` to `2021-06-01`.
- Introduced new property `TargetResourceGroupId` on `Azure.ResourceManager.Resources.Models.ResourcesMoveContent` to supersede `TargetResourceGroup` to emphasize this is accepting a `ResourceIdentifier` of the target resource group.

## 1.4.0 (2023-02-10)

### Features Added

- Added `SetApiVersionsFromProfile` method in `ArmClientOptions` to support setting resource API versions from an Azure Stack Profile.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed the exception in `GenericResource` operations caused by case-sensitive comparison of resource types between user input and service results.

### Other Changes

- Upgraded dependent `Azure.Core` to `1.28.0`.
- Upgraded resources API version to `2022-09-01`.
  - The `GetAll` methods of `ResourceProviderCollection`, `GetTenantResourceProviders` methods of `ArmClient` removed the `top` parameter as it's never supported by service. We added back overloaded methods with the `top` parameter, but made it with `expand` parameter both as required. It is compatible with most previous method usages but still breaks a few cases such as (take `GetAll` as an example):
    - GetAll(10)
    - GetAll(top: 10)
    - GetAll(top: null)
    - GetAll(10, cancellationToken: token)
    - GetAll(top: 10, cancellationToken: token)
    - GetAll(top: null, cancellationToken: token)
  - The `Update` methods of `TagResource` became LRO and added a `waitUntil` parameter in the beginning. The old methods without the `waitUntil` parameter is kept with obsolete warnings to keep backward-compatibility.

### Breaking Changes

- Simplified CreateOrUpdate and Delete methods to no longer have Start variants for LongRunningOperations.
  - CreateOrUpdate and Delete now take an optional parameter `waitForCompletion` that defaults to true and determines whether the method waits for the operation to complete before returning.

  - If `waitForCompletion` is false, you can control the polling, but must call `WaitForCompletionAsync()` before accessing `Value`.
