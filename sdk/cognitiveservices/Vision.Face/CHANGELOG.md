# Release History

## 2.8.0-preview.3 (2022-11-25)

### Breaking Changes
- Id fields in responses for Person and Face objects from Person Directory are no longer nullable as they are guaranteed to be returned.
- The non-functional AddPersonFaceAsync method has been removed from Person Directory.

### Bugs Fixed
- Fix mismatching data types between request and response for personId and persistedFaceId in Person Directory. New extension methods expecting GUIDs have been added alongside the existing string ones
- Fix the missing parameter "url" in Person Directory AddPersonFaceAsync, which is now renamed to AddPersonFaceFromUrlAsync for clarity.
