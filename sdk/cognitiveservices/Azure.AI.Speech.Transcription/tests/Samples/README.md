Source files in this directory are written as tests from which samples are
extracted. They are not intended to be viewed directly and help ensure our samples
compile and work correctly. See our [list of samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/cognitiveservices/Azure.AI.Speech.Transcription/samples) for more explanation about how to use this client library.
