This library provides access to the Azure Digital Twins service for managing twins, models, relationships, etc.
 
  [Source code][source] | [Package (nuget)][package]

## Getting started

### Authenticate the Client

### Install the package

Install the Azure Digital Twins client library for .NET with [NuGet][nuget]:

```PowerShell
Install-Package Azure.DigitalTwins.Core
```
### Prerequisites

* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].

## Key concepts

## Examples

## Developer guide

### Source code folder structure

### /src
The digital twins public client `DigitalTwinsClient` and the additional configuration options that can be sent to the digital twins service `DigitalTwinsClientOptions`.

### /src/swagger
The swagger file that defines the structure of the REST APIs used by the digital twins client library.

To generate the code, run the powershell script present [here](./src/generate.ps1).

### /src/Generated
The code generated by autorest using the swagger file defined under /src/swagger. 

### /src/Customized
The customzied code written to override the following behavior of auto-generated code:
- Rename some of the generated types, eg. [GetModelsOptions](./src/Customized/Models/GetModelsOptions.cs)
- Declare some of the generated types as **internal**, instead of the autorest default of **public**.
- Declare some methods to accept input parameters as **strings** instead of **objects**.
- Declare some methods to return the response as **strings** instead of **objects**.

### /src/Models
Constants useful for use with the digital twins client.

### /src/Properties
Assembly properties required for running unit tests against signed assemblies in Debug mode.

### /src/Serialization
Serialization helpers provided to help serialize/deseralize commonly used types within the digital twins service.

Any time the client library code is updated, you will need to run the script [here](./../Export-AdtApis.ps1), which will update the corresponding API surface.
