## Swagger customization

These changes should eventually be included in the swagger or at least centralized in Azure/azure-rest-api-specs.

### Ignore 404s for DELETE operations

Treat HTTP 404 responses for DELETE operations for RBAC as non-errors.

``` yaml
directive:
- where-operation: RoleAssignments_Delete
  transform: >
    $.responses["404"] = {
        "description": "The resource to delete does not exist.",
        "x-ms-error-response": false
    };

- where-operation: RoleDefinitions_Delete
  transform: >
    $.responses["404"] = {
        "description": "The resource to delete does not exist.",
        "x-ms-error-response": false
    };
```

### Return void for DELETE operations

Do not parse response bodies unnecessarily.

``` yaml
directive:
- where-operation: RoleAssignments_Delete
  transform: >
    delete $.responses["200"].schema;

- where-operation: RoleDefinitions_Delete
  transform: >
    delete $.responses["200"].schema;
```
