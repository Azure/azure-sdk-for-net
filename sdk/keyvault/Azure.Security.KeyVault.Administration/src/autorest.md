## Swagger customizations

These changes should eventually be included in the swagger or at least centralized in Azure/azure-rest-api-specs.

### Ignore 404s for DELETE operations

Treat HTTP 404 responses for DELETE operations for RBAC as non-errors.

``` yaml
directive:
- where-operation: RoleAssignments_Delete
  transform: >
    $.responses["404"] = {
        "description": "The resource to delete does not exist.",
        "x-ms-error-response": false
    };

- where-operation: RoleDefinitions_Delete
  transform: >
    $.responses["404"] = {
        "description": "The resource to delete does not exist.",
        "x-ms-error-response": false
    };
```

### Return void for DELETE operations

Do not parse response bodies unnecessarily.

``` yaml
directive:
- where-operation: RoleAssignments_Delete
  transform: >
    delete $.responses["200"].schema;

- where-operation: RoleDefinitions_Delete
  transform: >
    delete $.responses["200"].schema;
```

#### Specify client name for settings operations

``` yaml
directive:
- rename-operation:
    from: UpdateSetting
    to: Settings_UpdateSetting
- rename-operation:
    from: GetSetting
    to: Settings_GetSetting
- rename-operation:
    from: GetSettings
    to: Settings_GetSettings
```

## C# customizations

``` yaml
directive:
# [CodeGenMember("Type")] yields errors, so we have to rename via autorest transform.
- where: $.definitions.Setting.properties.type
  from: swagger-document
  transform: >
    $["x-ms-client-name"] = "SettingType";

# [CodeGenSuppress("Value")] yields errors, so we have to rename via autorest transforms.
- where: $.definitions.Setting.properties.value
  from: swagger-document
  transform: >
    $["x-ms-client-name"] = "content";
```
