# Get a Certificate Including the Private Key

[Azure Key Vault certificates][azure-keyvault-certificates] are a great way to manage certificates. They allow you to set policies, automatically renew near-expiring certificates, and permit cryptographic operations with access to the private key. There are times, however, when you may want to download and use the entire certificate - including the private key - locally. You might have a legacy application, for example, that needs access to a key pair.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend you keep cryptographic operations using the private key - including decryption, signing, and unwrapping - in Key Vault to minimize access to the private and mitigate possible breaches with a properly secured Key Vault.

Key Vault stores the public key as a managed key but the entire key pair including the private key - if created or imported as exportable - as a [secret][azure-keyvault-secrets]. This example shows you how download the key pair and uses it to encrypt and decrypt a plain text message.

## Getting Started

This sample requires creating a certificate with an exportable private key. You'll also need to download and install the [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-cli).

1. Log into Azure using the CLI:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. Create a Key Vault if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   az keyvault create -n <KeyVaultName> -g <ResourceGroupName> -l <Location>
   ```

3. Create a certificate policy. You can get the default policy for a self-signed certificate as shown below:

   > [!NOTE]
   > Saving program output to a variable may vary depending on your shell.

   ```bash
   p=$(az keyvault certificate get-default-policy)
   echo $p
   ```

4. Create a certificate using that policy:

   ```bash
   az keyvault certificate create --vault-name <KeyVaultName> -n <CertificateName> -p "$p"
   ```

## Building the Sample

To build the sample:

1. Install [.NET Core 3.1](https://dot.net) or newer.

2. Run in the project directory:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

## Running the Sample

You can either run the executable you just build, or build and run the project at the same time:

```bash
dotnet run -- --vault-name <KeyVaultName> -n <CertificateName> -m "Message you want to encrypt and decrypt"
```

The sample will get information about the specified certificate, download the key pair as a secret, then encrypt and decrypt your message as a test.
