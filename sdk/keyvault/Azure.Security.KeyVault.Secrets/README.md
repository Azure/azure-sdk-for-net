# Azure Key Vault secret client library for .NET
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure storage of secrets, such as passwords and database connection strings.

The secret client library allows you to securely store and control the access to tokens, passwords, API keys, and other secrets. This library offers operations to create, retrieve, update, delete, purge, backup, restore and list the secrets and its versions.

## Getting started

### Install the package
Install the Azure Key Vault client library for .NET with [NuGet][nuget]:

```PowerShell
Install-Package Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets -IncludePrerelease
```

### Prerequisites
* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
* An existing Key Vault. If you need to create a Key Vault, you can use the Azure Portal or [Azure CLI][azure_cli].

If you use the Azure CLI, replace `<your-resource-group-name>` and `<your-key-vault-name>` with your own, unique names:

```PowerShell
az keyvault create --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-key-vault-name>
```

### Authenticate the client
In order to interact with the Key Vault service, you'll need to create an instance of the [SecretClient][secret_client_class] class. You would need a **vault url** and **client secret credentials (client id, client secret, tenant id)** to instantiate a client object.

Client secret credential authentication is being used in this getting started section but you can find more ways to authenticate with [Azure identity][azure_identity].

 #### Create/Get credentials
Use the [Azure CLI][azure_cli] snippet below to create/get client secret credentials.

 * Create a service principal and configure its access to Azure resources:
    ```PowerShell
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n <your-application-name> --skip-assignment
    ```
    Output:
    ```json
    {
        "appId": "generated-app-ID",
        "displayName": "dummy-app-name",
        "name": "http://dummy-app-name",
        "password": "random-password",
        "tenant": "tenant-ID"
    }
    ```
* Use the returned credentials above to set  **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**(appId), **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET**(password) and **AZURE_TENANT_ID**(tenant) environment variables. The following example shows a way to do this in Powershell:
    ```PowerShell
    $Env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID="generated-app-ID"
    $Env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="random-password"
    $Env:AZURE_TENANT_ID="tenant-ID"
    ```
    
* Grant the above mentioned application authorization to perform secret operations on the Key Vault:
    ```PowerShell
    az keyvault set-policy --name <your-key-vault-name> --spn $AZURE_CLIENT_ID --secret-permissions backup delete get list set
    ```
    > --secret-permissions:
    > Accepted values: backup, delete, get, list, purge, recover, restore, set

* Use the above mentioned Key Vault name to retrieve details of your Vault which also contains your Key Vault URL:
    ```PowerShell
    az keyvault show --name <your-key-vault-name> 
    ```

#### Create SecretClient
Once you've populated the **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**, **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET** and **AZURE_TENANT_ID** environment variables and replaced **your-vault-url** with the above returned URI, you can create the [SecretClient][secret_client_class]:

```C# Snippet:CreateSecretClient
// Create a new secret client using the default credential from Azure.Identity using environment variables previously set,
// including AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, and AZURE_TENANT_ID.
var client = new SecretClient(vaultUri: new Uri(keyVaultUrl), credential: new DefaultAzureCredential());

// Create a new secret using the secret client.
KeyVaultSecret secret = client.SetSecret("secret-name", "secret-value");

// Retrieve a secret using the secret client.
secret = client.GetSecret("secret-name");
```

## Key concepts
### KeyVaultSecret
A `KeyVaultSecret` is the fundamental resource within Azure Key Vault. From a developer's perspective, Key Vault APIs accept and return secret values as strings.

### SecretClient
A `SecretClient` provides both synchronous and asynchronous operations in the SDK allowing for selection of a client based on an application's use case.
Once you've initialized a `SecretClient`, you can interact with secrets in Key Vault.

## Examples
The Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets package supports synchronous and asynchronous APIs.

The following section provides several code snippets using the [above created](#create-secretclient) `client`, covering some of the most common Azure Key Vault secret service related tasks:

### Async examples
* [Create a secret](#create-a-secret)
* [Retrieve a secret](#retrieve-a-secret)
* [Update an existing secret](#update-an-existing-secret)
* [Delete a secret](#delete-a-secret)
* [Delete and purge a secret](#delete-and-purge-a-secret)
* [List Secrets](#list-secrets)

### Sync examples
* [Create a secret synchronously](#create-a-secret-synchronously)
* [Delete a secret synchronously](#delete-a-secret-synchronously)

### Create a secret
`SetSecretAsync` creates a `KeyVaultSecret` to be stored in the Azure Key Vault. If a secret with the same name already exists, then a new version of the secret is created.

```C# Snippet:CreateSecret
KeyVaultSecret secret = await client.SetSecretAsync("secret-name", "secret-value");

Console.WriteLine(secret.Name);
Console.WriteLine(secret.Value);
Console.WriteLine(secret.Properties.Version);
Console.WriteLine(secret.Properties.Enabled);
```

### Retrieve a secret
`GetSecretAsync` retrieves a secret previously stored in the Key Vault.

```C# Snippet:RetrieveSecret
KeyVaultSecret secret = await client.GetSecretAsync("secret-name");

Console.WriteLine(secret.Name);
Console.WriteLine(secret.Value);
```

### Update an existing secret
`UpdateSecretPropertiesAsync` updates a secret previously stored in the Key Vault. Only the attributes of the secret are updated. To update the value, call `SecretClient.SetSecretAsync` on a secret with the same name.

```C# Snippet:UpdateSecret
KeyVaultSecret secret = await client.GetSecretAsync("secret-name");

// Clients may specify the content type of a secret to assist in interpreting the secret data when it's retrieved.
secret.Properties.ContentType = "text/plain";

// You can specify additional application-specific metadata in the form of tags.
secret.Properties.Tags["foo"] = "updated tag";

SecretProperties updatedSecretProperties = await client.UpdateSecretPropertiesAsync(secret.Properties);

Console.WriteLine(updatedSecretProperties.Name);
Console.WriteLine(updatedSecretProperties.Version);
Console.WriteLine(updatedSecretProperties.ContentType);
```

### Delete a secret
`StartDeleteSecretAsync` starts a long-running operation to delete a secret previously stored in the Key Vault.
You can retrieve the secret immediately without waiting for the operation to complete.
When [soft-delete][soft_delete] is not enabled for the Key Vault, this operation permanently deletes the secret.

```C# Snippet:DeleteSecret
DeleteSecretOperation operation = await client.StartDeleteSecretAsync("secret-name");

DeletedSecret secret = operation.Value;
Console.WriteLine(secret.Name);
Console.WriteLine(secret.Value);
```

### Delete and purge a secret
You will need to wait for the long-running operation to complete before trying to purge or recover the secret.

```C# Snippet:DeleteAndPurgeSecret
DeleteSecretOperation operation = await client.StartDeleteSecretAsync("secret-name");

// You only need to wait for completion if you want to purge or recover the secret.
await operation.WaitForCompletionAsync();

DeletedSecret secret = operation.Value;
await client.PurgeDeletedSecretAsync(secret.Name);
```

### List secrets
This example lists all the secrets in the specified Key Vault. The value is not returned when listing all secrets. You will need to call `SecretClient.GetSecretAsync` to retrieve the value.

```C# Snippet:ListSecrets
AsyncPageable<SecretProperties> allSecrets = client.GetPropertiesOfSecretsAsync();

await foreach (SecretProperties secretProperties in allSecrets)
{
    Console.WriteLine(secretProperties.Name);
}
```

### Create a secret synchronously
Synchronous APIs are identical to their asynchronous counterparts, but without the typical "Async" suffix for asynchronous methods.

This example creates a secret in the Key Vault with the specified optional arguments.

```C# Snippet:CreateSecretSync
KeyVaultSecret secret = client.SetSecret("secret-name", "secret-value");

Console.WriteLine(secret.Name);
Console.WriteLine(secret.Value);
```

### Delete a secret synchronously
When deleting a secret synchronously before you purge it, you need to call `UpdateStatus` on the returned operation periodically.
You could do this in a loop as shown in the example, or periodically within other operations in your program.

```C# Snippet:DeleteSecretSync
DeleteSecretOperation operation = client.StartDeleteSecret("secret-name");

// You only need to wait for completion if you want to purge or recover the secret.
while (!operation.HasCompleted)
{
    Thread.Sleep(2000);

    operation.UpdateStatus();
}

DeletedSecret secret = operation.Value;
client.PurgeDeletedSecret(secret.Name);
```

## Troubleshooting

### General
When you interact with the Azure Key Vault secret client library using the .NET SDK, errors returned by the service correspond to the same HTTP status codes returned for [REST API][keyvault_rest] requests.

For example, if you try to retrieve a secret that doesn't exist in your Key Vault, a `404` error is returned, indicating `Not Found`.

```C# Snippet:SecretNotFound
try
{
    KeyVaultSecret secret = await client.GetSecretAsync("some_secret");
}
catch (RequestFailedException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
}
```

You will notice that additional information is logged, like the Client Request ID of the operation.

```

    Azure.RequestFailedException : Service request failed.
    Status: 404 (Not Found)
