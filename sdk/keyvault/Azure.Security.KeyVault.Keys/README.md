# Azure Key Vault key client library for .NET
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides secure storage of keys for encrypting your data. Multiple keys, and multiple versions of the same key, can be kept in the Azure Key Vault. Cryptographic keys in Azure Key Vault are represented as [JSON Web Key (JWK)][JWK] objects.

The Azure Key Vault keys library client supports RSA keys and Elliptic Curve (EC) keys, each with corresponding support in hardware security modules (HSM). It offers operations to create, retrieve, update, delete, purge, backup, restore, and list the keys and its versions.

## Getting started

### Install the package
Install the Azure Key Vault keys client library for .NET with [NuGet][nuget]:

```PowerShell
dotnet install Azure.Security.KeyVault.Keys
```

### Prerequisites
* An [Azure subscription][azure_sub].
* An existing Azure Key Vault. If you need to create an Azure Key Vault, you can use the Azure Portal or [Azure CLI][azure_cli].

If you use the Azure CLI, replace `<your-resource-group-name>` and `<your-key-vault-name>` with your own, unique names:

```PowerShell
az keyvault create --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-key-vault-name>
```

### Authenticate the client
In order to interact with the Key Vault service, you'll need to create an instance of the [KeyClient][key_client_class] class. You need a **vault url**, which you may see as "DNS Name" in the portal,
 and **client secret credentials (client id, client secret, tenant id)** to instantiate a client object.

Client secret credential authentication is being used in this getting started section but you can find more ways to authenticate with [Azure identity][azure_identity]. To use the [DefaultAzureCredential][DefaultAzureCredential] provider shown below,
or other credential providers provided with the Azure SDK, you should install the Azure.Identity package:

```PowerShell
dotnet install Azure.Identity
```

#### Create/Get credentials
Use the [Azure CLI][azure_cli] snippet below to create/get client secret credentials.

 * Create a service principal and configure its access to Azure resources:
    ```PowerShell
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n <your-application-name> --skip-assignment
    ```
    Output:
    ```json
    {
        "appId": "generated-app-ID",
        "displayName": "dummy-app-name",
        "name": "http://dummy-app-name",
        "password": "random-password",
        "tenant": "tenant-ID"
    }
    ```
* Use the returned credentials above to set  **AZURE_CLIENT_ID** (appId), **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET** (password), and **AZURE_TENANT_ID** (tenant) environment variables. The following example shows a way to do this in Powershell:
    ```PowerShell
    $Env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID="generated-app-ID"
    $Env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="random-password"
    $Env:AZURE_TENANT_ID="tenant-ID"
    ```

* Grant the above mentioned application authorization to perform key operations on the Azure Key Vault:
    ```PowerShell
    az keyvault set-policy --name <your-key-vault-name> --spn $AZURE_CLIENT_ID --key-permissions backup delete get list create encrypt decrypt update
    ```
    > --key-permissions:
    > Accepted values: backup, create, decrypt, delete, encrypt, get, import, list, purge, recover, restore, sign, unwrapKey, update, verify, wrapKey

* Use the above mentioned Azure Key Vault name to retrieve details of your Vault which also contains your Azure Key Vault URL:
    ```PowerShell
    az keyvault show --name <your-key-vault-name>
    ```

#### Create KeyClient
Once you've populated the **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**, **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET** and **AZURE_TENANT_ID** environment variables and replaced **your-vault-url** with the above returned URI, you can create the [KeyClient][key_client_class]:

```C# Snippet:CreateKeyClient
// Create a new key client using the default credential from Azure.Identity using environment variables previously set,
// including AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, and AZURE_TENANT_ID.
var client = new KeyClient(vaultUri: new Uri(keyVaultUrl), credential: new DefaultAzureCredential());

// Create a new key using the key client.
KeyVaultKey key = client.CreateKey("key-name", KeyType.Rsa);

// Retrieve a key using the key client.
key = client.GetKey("key-name");
```

#### Create CryptographyClient
Once you've created a `KeyVaultKey` in the Azure Key Vault, you can also create the [CryptographyClient][crypto_client_class]:

```C# Snippet:CreateCryptographyClient
// Create a new cryptography client using the default credential from Azure.Identity using environment variables previously set,
// including AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, and AZURE_TENANT_ID.
var cryptoClient = new CryptographyClient(keyId: key.Id, credential: new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

## Key concepts

### KeyVaultKey
Azure Key Vault supports multiple key types and algorithms, and enables the use of hardware security modules (HSM) for high value keys.

### KeyClient
A `KeyClient` providing both synchronous and asynchronous operations exists in the SDK allowing for selection of a client based on an application's use case. Once you've initialized a `KeyClient`, you can interact with the primary resource types in Azure Key Vault.

### CryptographyClient
A `CryptographyClient` providing both synchronous and asynchronous operations exists in the SDK allowing for selection of a client based on an application's use case. Once you've initialized a `CryptographyClient`, you can use it to perform cryptographic operations with keys stored in Azure Key Vault.

## Examples
The Azure.Security.KeyVault.Keys package supports synchronous and asynchronous APIs.

The following section provides several code snippets using the `client` [created above](#create-keyclient), covering some of the most common Azure Key Vault key service related tasks:

### Sync examples
* [Create a key](#create-a-key)
* [Retrieve a key](#retrieve-a-key)
* [Update an existing key](#update-an-existing-key)
* [Delete a key](#delete-a-key)
* [Delete and purge a key](#delete-and-purge-a-key)
* [List keys](#list-keys)
* [Encrypt and Decrypt](#encrypt-and-decrypt)

### Async examples
* [Create a key asynchronously](#create-a-key-asynchronously)
* [List keys asynchronously](#list-keys-asynchronously)
* [Delete a key asynchronously](#delete-a-key-asynchronously)

### Create a key
Create a key to be stored in the Azure Key Vault. If a key with the same name already exists, then a new version of the key is created.

```C# Snippet:CreateKey
// Create a key. Note that you can specify the type of key
// i.e. Elliptic curve, Hardware Elliptic Curve, RSA
KeyVaultKey key = client.CreateKey("key-name", KeyType.Rsa);

Console.WriteLine(key.Name);
Console.WriteLine(key.KeyType);

// Create a software RSA key
var rsaCreateKey = new CreateRsaKeyOptions("rsa-key-name", hardwareProtected: false);
KeyVaultKey rsaKey = client.CreateRsaKey(rsaCreateKey);

Console.WriteLine(rsaKey.Name);
Console.WriteLine(rsaKey.KeyType);

// Create a hardware Elliptic Curve key
// Because only premium Azure Key Vault supports HSM backed keys , please ensure your Azure Key Vault
// SKU is premium when you set "hardwareProtected" value to true
var echsmkey = new CreateEcKeyOptions("ec-key-name", hardwareProtected: true);
KeyVaultKey ecKey = client.CreateEcKey(echsmkey);

Console.WriteLine(ecKey.Name);
Console.WriteLine(ecKey.KeyType);
```

### Retrieve a key
`GetKeyAsync` retrieves a key previously stored in the Azure Key Vault.

```C# Snippet:RetrieveKey
KeyVaultKey key = client.GetKey("key-name");

Console.WriteLine(key.Name);
Console.WriteLine(key.KeyType);
```

### Update an existing key
`UpdateKeyProperties` updates a key previously stored in the Azure Key Vault.

```C# Snippet:UpdateKey
KeyVaultKey key = client.CreateKey("key-name", KeyType.Rsa);

// You can specify additional application-specific metadata in the form of tags.
key.Properties.Tags["foo"] = "updated tag";

KeyVaultKey updatedKey = client.UpdateKeyProperties(key.Properties);

Console.WriteLine(updatedKey.Name);
Console.WriteLine(updatedKey.Properties.Version);
Console.WriteLine(updatedKey.Properties.UpdatedOn);
```

### Delete a key
`StartDeleteKey` starts a long-running operation to delete a key previously stored in the Azure Key Vault.
You can retrieve the key immediately without waiting for the operation to complete.
When [soft-delete][soft_delete] is not enabled for the Azure Key Vault, this operation permanently deletes the key.

```C# Snippet:DeleteKey
DeleteKeyOperation operation = client.StartDeleteKey("key-name");

DeletedKey key = operation.Value;
Console.WriteLine(key.Name);
Console.WriteLine(key.DeletedOn);
```

### Delete and purge a key
You will need to wait for the long-running operation to complete before trying to purge or recover the key.

```C# Snippet:DeleteAndPurgeKey
DeleteKeyOperation operation = client.StartDeleteKey("key-name");

// You only need to wait for completion if you want to purge or recover the key.
while (!operation.HasCompleted)
{
    Thread.Sleep(2000);

    operation.UpdateStatus();
}

DeletedKey key = operation.Value;
client.PurgeDeletedKey(key.Name);
```

### List Keys
This example lists all the keys in the specified Azure Key Vault.

```C# Snippet:ListKeys
Pageable<KeyProperties> allKeys = client.GetPropertiesOfKeys();

foreach (KeyProperties keyProperties in allKeys)
{
    Console.WriteLine(keyProperties.Name);
}
```

### Encrypt and Decrypt
This example creates a `CryptographyClient` and uses it to encrypt and decrypt with a key in Azure Key Vault.

```C# Snippet:EncryptDecrypt
byte[] plaintext = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("A single block of plaintext");

// encrypt the data using the algorithm RSAOAEP
EncryptResult encryptResult = cryptoClient.Encrypt(EncryptionAlgorithm.RsaOaep, plaintext);

// decrypt the encrypted data.
DecryptResult decryptResult = cryptoClient.Decrypt(EncryptionAlgorithm.RsaOaep, encryptResult.Ciphertext);
```

### Create a key asynchronously
The asynchronous APIs are identical to their synchronous counterparts, but return with the typical "Async" suffix for asynchronous methods and return a Task.

```C# Snippet:CreateKeyAsync
// Create a key of any type
KeyVaultKey key = await client.CreateKeyAsync("key-name", KeyType.Rsa);

Console.WriteLine(key.Name);
Console.WriteLine(key.KeyType);

// Create a software RSA key
var rsaCreateKey = new CreateRsaKeyOptions("rsa-key-name", hardwareProtected: false);
KeyVaultKey rsaKey = await client.CreateRsaKeyAsync(rsaCreateKey);

Console.WriteLine(rsaKey.Name);
Console.WriteLine(rsaKey.KeyType);

// Create a hardware Elliptic Curve key
// Because only premium Azure Key Vault supports HSM backed keys , please ensure your Azure Key Vault
// SKU is premium when you set "hardwareProtected" value to true
var echsmkey = new CreateEcKeyOptions("ec-key-name", hardwareProtected: true);
KeyVaultKey ecKey = await client.CreateEcKeyAsync(echsmkey);

Console.WriteLine(ecKey.Name);
Console.WriteLine(ecKey.KeyType);
```

### List keys asynchronously

Listing keys does not rely on awaiting the `GetPropertiesOfKeysAsync` method, but returns an `AsyncPageable<KeyProperties>` that you can use with the `await foreach` statement:

```C# Snippet:ListKeysAsync
AsyncPageable<KeyProperties> allKeys = client.GetPropertiesOfKeysAsync();

await foreach (KeyProperties keyProperties in allKeys)
{
    Console.WriteLine(keyProperties.Name);
}
```

### Delete a key asynchronously
When deleting a key asynchronously before you purge it, you can await the `WaitForCompletionAsync` method on the operation.
By default, this loops indefinitely but you can cancel it by passing a `CancellationToken`.

```C# Snippet:DeleteAndPurgeKeyAsync
DeleteKeyOperation operation = await client.StartDeleteKeyAsync("key-name");

// You only need to wait for completion if you want to purge or recover the key.
await operation.WaitForCompletionAsync();

DeletedKey key = operation.Value;
await client.PurgeDeletedKeyAsync(key.Name);
```

## Troubleshooting

### General
When you interact with the Azure Key Vault key client library using the .NET SDK, errors returned by the service correspond to the same HTTP status codes returned for [REST API][keyvault_rest] requests.

For example, if you try to retrieve a key that doesn't exist in your Azure Key Vault, a `404` error is returned, indicating "Not Found".

```C# Snippet:KeyNotFound
try
{
    KeyVaultKey key = client.GetKey("some_key");
}
catch (RequestFailedException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
}
```

You will notice that additional information is logged, like the client request ID of the operation.

```
Message:
    Azure.RequestFailedException : Service request failed.
    Status: 404 (Not Found)
Content:
    {"error":{"code":"KeyNotFound","message":"Key not found: some_key"}}
