# Encrypting and decrypt keys

This sample demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt a single block of plain text with an RSA key.
To get started, you'll need a URI to an Azure Key Vault. See the [README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/keyvault/Azure.Security.KeyVault.Keys/README.md) for links and instructions.

## Creating a KeyClient

To create a new `KeyClient` to create, get, update, or delete keys, you need the endpoint to an Azure Key Vault and credentials.
You can use the [DefaultAzureCredential][DefaultAzureCredential] to try a number of common authentication methods optimized for both running as a service and development.

In the sample below, you can set `keyVaultUrl` based on an environment variable, configuration setting, or any way that works for your application.

```C# Snippet:KeysSample4KeyClient
var keyClient = new KeyClient(new Uri(keyVaultUrl), new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

## Creating a key

First, we create a RSA key which will be used to encrypt and decrypt.

```C# Snippet:KeysSample4CreateKey
// Let's create a RSA key which will be used to encrypt and decrypt
string rsaKeyName = $"CloudRsaKey-{Guid.NewGuid()}";
var rsaKey = new CreateRsaKeyOptions(rsaKeyName, hardwareProtected: false)
{
    KeySize = 2048,
};

KeyVaultKey cloudRsaKey = keyClient.CreateRsaKey(rsaKey);
Debug.WriteLine($"Key is returned with name {cloudRsaKey.Name} and type {cloudRsaKey.KeyType}");
```

## Creating a CryptographyClient

We create the `CryptographyClient` which can perform cryptographic operations with the key we just created using the same credential created above.

```C# Snippet:KeysSample4CryptographyClient
var cryptoClient = new CryptographyClient(cloudRsaKey.Id, new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

## Encrypting a key

Next, we'll encrypt some arbitrary plaintext with the key using the CryptographyClient.
Note that RSA encryption algorithms have no chaining so they can only encrypt a single block of plaintext securely.

```C# Snippet:KeysSample4EncryptKey
byte[] plaintext = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("A single block of plaintext");
EncryptResult encryptResult = cryptoClient.Encrypt(EncryptionAlgorithm.RsaOaep, plaintext);
Debug.WriteLine($"Encrypted data using the algorithm {encryptResult.Algorithm}, with key {encryptResult.KeyId}. The resulting encrypted data is {Convert.ToBase64String(encryptResult.Ciphertext)}");
```

## Decrypting a key

Now decrypt the encrypted data. Note that the same algorithm must always be used for both encrypt and decrypt.

```C# Snippet:KeysSample4DecryptKey
DecryptResult decryptResult = cryptoClient.Decrypt(EncryptionAlgorithm.RsaOaep, encryptResult.Ciphertext);
Debug.WriteLine($"Decrypted data using the algorithm {decryptResult.Algorithm}, with key {decryptResult.KeyId}. The resulting decrypted data is {Encoding.UTF8.GetString(decryptResult.Plaintext)}");
```
