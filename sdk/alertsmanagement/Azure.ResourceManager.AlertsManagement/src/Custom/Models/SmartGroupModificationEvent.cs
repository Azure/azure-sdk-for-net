    // published GA package (Azure.ResourceManager.AlertsManagement v1.1.x).
    //
    // Why it lives here instead of being regenerated:
    //   The SmartGroup operation group is deliberately out of scope for this migration's TypeSpec spec
    //   (specification/alertsmanagement/.../Microsoft.AlertsManagement/AlertsManagement). The
    //   underlying service operations still exist but will be shipped from a separate dedicated package
    //   in a future release, so the MPG generator does not (and must not) emit these types here.
    //
    // What this stub provides:
    //   The type is declared with the original v1.1.x signature so that consumer assemblies compiled
    //   against the old GA still load, but every member throws NotSupportedException at runtime. The
    //   type is also marked [Obsolete(..., error: true)] + [EditorBrowsable(Never)] so the C# compiler
    //   redirects new callers to the future dedicated SmartGroup package.
