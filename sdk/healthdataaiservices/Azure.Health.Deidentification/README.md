  [Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/healthdataaiservices/Azure.Health.Deidentification/src) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages) | [API reference documentation](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-net) | [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure) -->

## Getting started


### Install the package

Install the client library for .NET with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/ ):

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Health.Deidentification --prerelease
```

### Prerequisites


> You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) and `Deid Service`.

### Authenticate the client

Pull `ServiceUrl` from your created Deidentification Service.

![Service Url Location](docs/images/ServiceUrl_Location.png)

Basic code snippet to create your Deidentification Client and Deidentify a string.

```cs
        const string serviceEndpoint = "https://example.api.cac001.deid.azure.com";
        TokenCredential credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();

        DeidentificationClient client = new(
            new Uri(serviceEndpoint),
            credential,
            new DeidentificationClientOptions()
        );

        DeidentificationContent content = new("Hello, John!", OperationType.Surrogate, DocumentDataType.Plaintext);

        Response<DeidentificationResult> result = client.Deidentify(content);
        string outputString = result.Value.OutputText;
        Console.WriteLine(outputString); // Hello, Tom!
```

## Key concepts

Operation Modes:
- Tag: Will return a structure of offset and length with the PHI category of the related text spans.
- Redact: Will return output text with placeholder stubbed text. ex. `[name]`
- Surrogate: Will return output text with synthetic replacements.
  - `My name is John Smith`
  - `My name is Tom Jones`

### Thread safety

We guarantee that all client instance methods are thread-safe and independent of each other ([guideline](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-service-methods-thread-safety)). This ensures that the recommendation of reusing client instances is always safe, even across threads.

## Examples

You can familiarize yourself with different APIs using [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/healthdataaiservices/Azure.Health.Deidentification/samples).

<!-- TODO
## Troubleshooting

Describe common errors and exceptions, how to "unpack" them if necessary, and include guidance for graceful handling and recovery.

Provide information to help developers avoid throttling or other service-enforced errors they might encounter. For example, provide guidance and examples for using retry or connection policies in the API.

If the package or a related package supports it, include tips for logging or enabling instrumentation to help them debug their code.

## Next steps

* Provide a link to additional code examples, ideally to those sitting alongside the README in the package's `/samples` directory.
* If appropriate, point users to other packages that might be useful.
* If you think there's a good chance that developers might stumble across your package in error (because they're searching for specific functionality and mistakenly think the package provides that functionality), point them to the packages they might be looking for.

## Contributing

This is a template, but your SDK readme should include details on how to contribute code to the repo/package.
