Mr. Doe is a 97-year-old gentleman who presented to the clinic today complaining of persistent lower back pain. He reports the pain as dull and achy, primarily localized to the lumbar region. Onset was approximately three weeks ago, following a period of heavy lifting during a recent move. The pain is exacerbated by prolonged sitting and relieved with rest. No associated symptoms of radiculopathy, such as numbness or weakness, were reported.
