Roasting:\n   - Preheat your oven to 400\u00B0F (200\u00B0C).\n   - Slice the bell pepper into halves or quarters and remove the seeds and membranes.\n   - Place the pepper pieces on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.\n   - Roast in the oven for about 20-25 minutes until the skin starts to blister and char.\n   - Remove from the oven and let the bell pepper cool slightly before serving or using in recipes.\n\n2. Saut\u00E9ing:\n   - Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium heat and add some cooking oil (olive oil or any other oil of your choice).\n   - Slice the bell pepper into strips or cubes, removing the seeds and membranes.\n   - Add the sliced bell pepper to the preheated skillet and saut\u00E9 for about 5-7 minutes until they become crisp-tender. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.\n   - Season with salt, pepper, or any other desired seasoning towards the end of cooking.\n   - Transfer the saut\u00E9ed peppers to a serving dish or use them in various recipes.\n\n3. Grilling:\n   - Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.\n   - Cut the bell pepper into halves or quarters, remove the seeds and membranes.\n   - Brush the peppers with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.\n   - Place the bell pepper pieces on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, until you get nice grill marks and the peppers are slightly softened.\n   - Remove from the grill and let them cool slightly before serving.\n\nThese methods will cook the peppers while adding a delicious flavor and texture. You can then enjoy the cooked bell pepper on its own, as a side dish, in salads, sandwiches, pasta, or in various recipes."

Cut the bell pepper in half and remove the stem, seeds, and white membrane. Place the halves on a baking sheet, skin side up. Roast for about 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blistered. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes. Peel off the skin and use the roasted bell pepper in your desired recipe.\n\n2. Saut\u00E9ing: Slice the bell pepper into thin strips or dice it. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the sliced or diced pepper and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the pepper softens and slightly caramelizes. You can cook it alone or with other vegetables or proteins.\n\n3. Grilling: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Cut the bell pepper in half, remove the stem, seeds, and white membrane. Brush the cut sides with some oil. Place the pepper halves directly on the grill grate, cut side down. Grill for about 5-7 minutes until the skin is charred and the flesh is soft. Remove from the grill and let cool for a few minutes. Peel off the skin and use the grilled bell pepper as desired.\n\n4. Stuffing: Cut the bell pepper in half and remove the stem, seeds, and white membrane. Fill the halves with your desired stuffing, such as rice and ground meat or quinoa and vegetables. Place the stuffed peppers in a baking dish and bake at 375\u00B0F (190\u00B0C) for about 30-35 minutes or until the filling is cooked through and the pepper is tender.\n\nRemember to season the bell pepper to taste with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs or spices."
