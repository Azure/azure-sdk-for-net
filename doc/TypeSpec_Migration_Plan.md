# TypeSpec Migration Implementation Plan

This document outlines a strategic plan for migrating Azure SDK for .NET libraries from Swagger to TypeSpec.

## Current State

Based on the inventory analysis:

- **Total libraries**: 424
- **Data Plane (Swagger)**: 151
- **Management Plane (Swagger)**: 206
- **Unknown generator**: 67
- **TypeSpec**: None detected in production code

## Migration Goals

1. Migrate data plane libraries to TypeSpec first
2. Gradually migrate management plane libraries
3. Ensure all new libraries use TypeSpec by default
4. Minimize breaking changes during migration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation and Pilot (0-3 months)

1. **TypeSpec Infrastructure Setup**
   - Ensure TypeSpec tooling is fully integrated into build pipelines
   - Create documentation and training for the migration process
   - Establish quality gates and validation tools

2. **Pilot Migrations (2-3 libraries)**
   - Select 2-3 smaller data plane libraries for initial migration
   - Document challenges and solutions encountered
   - Refine the migration process based on pilot experience

3. **Measurement Framework**
   - Establish metrics to track migration progress
   - Create dashboards to visualize migration status

### Phase 2: Data Plane Migration (3-12 months)

1. **Prioritize Data Plane Libraries**
   - Group libraries by complexity (small, medium, large)
   - Consider service team availability and library usage

2. **Migration Execution**
   - Migrate libraries in batches of 5-10
   - Conduct thorough testing of each migration
   - Update documentation and samples as needed

3. **Validation and Verification**
   - Ensure no regression in functionality
   - Verify API compatibility
   - Check test coverage

### Phase 3: Management Plane Migration (12-24 months)

1. **ARM Model Standardization**
   - Ensure consistent ARM model usage across management libraries
   - Standardize patterns for management plane operations

2. **Phased Migration**
   - Group management libraries by resource provider
   - Migrate related libraries together

3. **Validation with ARM Team**
   - Coordinate with Azure Resource Manager team
   - Ensure compliance with ARM guidelines

### Phase 4: Completion and Standardization (24+ months)

1. **Cleanup and Standardization**
   - Ensure consistent patterns across all libraries
   - Deprecate legacy approaches

2. **Tooling Updates**
   - Update all tools and generators to use TypeSpec exclusively
   - Remove legacy Swagger-specific tools

3. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**
   - Update all documentation to reflect TypeSpec usage
   - Train teams on TypeSpec best practices

## Success Criteria

1. All actively maintained libraries migrated to TypeSpec
2. No new libraries created using Swagger
3. Consistent patterns used across all TypeSpec-based libraries
4. Improved API consistency and quality
5. Faster onboarding for new services

## Resources Required

1. **Engineering Capacity**
   - Dedicated migration team
   - Service team participation for validation

2. **Tools and Infrastructure**
   - TypeSpec authoring and validation tools
   - CI/CD pipeline updates

3. **Documentation and Training**
   - TypeSpec authoring guides
   - Best practices documentation

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Breaking Changes**
   - Ensure thorough compatibility testing
   - Plan version strategy for any necessary breaking changes

2. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Regular progress tracking
   - Adjust scope and timeline as needed

3. **Knowledge Gaps**
   - Provide training for teams
   - Create detailed documentation

## Next Steps

1. Form a TypeSpec migration working group
2. Select pilot libraries for initial migration
3. Establish detailed timeline and milestones
4. Begin infrastructure and tooling updates
