Note that the Git field to be filled into \"author\" should be Git username. OPS will map it into user's Full Name and show on the page. \nFor reference document, OPS system don't have a systematic way to get author name, so \"author\" meta is always filled at content side.\nNote that \"author\" meta filled by writer must be a valid username in GitHub. Otherwise OPS build will throw out error which will fail the build (before feature 833467 is implemented) or throw out warning (after feature 833467 is implemented). As for content on top of VSO Git, validation is not run because VSO don't support profile so there's not way to validate it so as nothing to be thrown out by OPS build upon invalid VSO \"author\".\n\nWhen one person leaves MS, all the MD files with his username input as \"author\" should be replaced by another person. If content side take no action, the page will still show the name of left person on the page (unless he has deleted its Git account which will fail/warn the build).\n\nNote:\nVSO Git don't provide a good way to return full name and user profile for a given username, so \"author\" meta is only saved at OPS back-end but not shown on UI of VSO based OPS page.\n\nPS: In original design, \"author\" and \"ms.author\" are considered as same metadata by OPS. OPS simply copy \"author\" meta to \"ms.author\".\nSince Feature 657981, these two meta are de-coupled: \"author\" display on page UI, while \"ms.author\" is the one who follow up with when there are issue with the article (including bad meta, verbatims, ratings etc).
