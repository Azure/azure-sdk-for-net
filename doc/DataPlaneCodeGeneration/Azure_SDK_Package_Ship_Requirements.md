# Azure sdk package ship requirements

Before the library package can be released, you will need to add several requirements manually, including tests, samples, README, and CHANGELOG.
You can refer to following guideline to add those requirements:

- Tests: <https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_implementation.html#testing>
- README/Samples: <https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-repository>
- Changelog: <https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_releases.html#change-logs>
- Other release concerns: <https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_releases.html>

## Tests

In this section, we will talk about adding unit tests and live tests and how to run them. You will notice that there is a test project under `Azure.<group>.<service>\tests`.

Here is the step by step process to add tests:requirements

- Add other client parameters in `<client-name>ClientTestEnvironment.cs`
- Update `<client-name>ClientTest.cs`.
  - Please refer to [Using the TestFramework](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/core/Azure.Core.TestFramework/README.md) to add tests.

**Note**:

- Before running live tests you will need to create live test resources, please refer to [Live Test Resource Management](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/eng/common/TestResources/README.md) to learn more about how to manage resources and update test environment.
- `Azure.<group>.<service>` is the Azure SDK package name and `<client-name>` is a client name, C# generator will generate a client which you can find in `Azure.<group>.<service>/Generated` directory.

**Learn more:** see the [docs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#to-test-1) to learn more about tests.

## Samples

In this section, we will talk about how to add samples. As you can see, we already have a `Samples` folder under `Azure.<group>.<service>/tests` directory. We run the samples as a part of tests. First, enter `Sample<number>_<scenario>.cs` and remove the existing commented sample tests. You will add the basic sample tests for your SDK in this file. Create more test files and add tests as per your scenarios.

**Learn more:** For general information about samples, see the [Samples Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/dotnet_introduction.html#dotnet-samples).

You will update all the `Sample<sample_number>_<scenario>.md` and README.md files under `Azure.<group>.<service>\samples` directory to the your service according to the examples in those files. Based on that [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/anomalydetector/Azure.AI.AnomalyDetector/samples/) is an example.

## Snippets

Snippets are the great way to reuse the sample code. Snippets allow us to verify that the code in our samples and READMEs is always up to date, and passes unit tests. We have added the snippet [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/template/Azure.Template/tests/Samples/Sample1_HelloWorld.cs#L21) in a sample and used it in the [README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/template/Azure.Template/README.md#get-secret). Please refer to [Updating Sample Snippets](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-sample-snippets) to add snippets in your samples.

## README

README.md file instructions are listed in `Azure.<group>.<service>/README.md` file. Please add/update the README.md file as per your library.

**Learn more:** to understand more about README, see the [README.md](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/template/Azure.Template/README.md). Based on that [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/keyvault/Azure.Security.KeyVault.Keys/README.md) is an example.

## Changelog

Update the CHANGELOG.md file which exists in `Azure.<group>.<service>/CHANGELOG.md`. For general information about the changelog, see the [Changelog Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_releases.html#change-logs).

## Add Convenience APIs

Adding convenience APIs is not required for Azure SDK data plane generated libraries, but doing so can provide customers with a better experience when they develop code using your library.  You should consider adding convenience APIs to the generated client to make it easier to use for the most common customer scenarios, or based on customer feedback.  Any convenience APIs you add should be approved with the Azure SDK architecture board.

You can add convienice APIs by adding a customization layer on top of the generated code.  Please see the [autorest.csharp README](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp#setup) for the details of adding the customization layer.  This is the preferred method for adding convenience APIs to your generated client.


If other modifications are needed to the generated API, you can consider making them directly to the Open API specification, which will have the benefit of making the changes to the library in all languages you generate the library in.  As a last resort, you can add modifications with swagger transforms in the `autorest.md` file.  Details for various transforms can be found in [Customizing the generated code](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp#customizing-the-generated-code).

Once you've made changes to the public API, you will need to run the `eng\scripts\Export-API.ps1` script to update the public API listing. This will generate a file in the library's directory similar to the example found in [sdk\template\Azure.Template\api\Azure.Template.netstandard2.0.cs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/template/Azure.Template/api/Azure.Template.netstandard2.0.cs).

e.g. Running the script for a project in `sdk\deviceupdate` would look like this:

```powershell
eng\scripts\Export-API.ps1 deviceupdate
```
