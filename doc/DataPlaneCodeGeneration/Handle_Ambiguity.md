# Handle Ambiguity Between Protocol Method and Convenience Method

## Background

In a DPG library, protocol methods will be generated for a swagger input, and both of protocol methods and convenience methods will be generated for a typespec input. We expect to make convenience method an overload of protocol method, so that users could be very clear they are representing the same operation. For example,

```C#
public virtual async Task<Response<Model>> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) // Convenience method
{
    ...
}

public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, RequestContext context = null) // Protocol method
{
    ...
}
```
However, this leads to compilation error
```
Error	CS0121	The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'SomeClass.OperationAsync(string, CancellationToken)' and 'SomeClass.OperationAsync(string, RequestContext)'
```
when calling `OperationAsync("<some string>")`.

## Solution

There are two ways to handle this error:

1. Make all the parameters in **protocol methods** to required.
```C#
public virtual async Task<Response<Model>> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) // Convenience method
{
    ...
}

public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId, RequestContext context) // Protocol method
{
    ...
}
```
2. Append `Value` to name of **convenience methods**.
```C#
public virtual async Task<Response<Model>> OperationValueAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) // Convenience method
{
    ...
}

public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, RequestContext context = null) // Protocol method
{
    ...
}
```

The first solution is our preference, so when codegen detects the existing of ambiguity, it chooses the first strategy to resolve the problem.

Only when protocol method already GAed so that we cannot change it, the codegen will choose the second strategy.

TO-DO: I actually don't know the difference between these two flags.
We also have two flags to let end user decide solution. But these two flags would be deprecated at any time.
- use-overloads-between-protocol-and-convenience: default `true`. With this flag unset, we will always generate optional `RequestContext` for protocol methods. If ambiguity happens, we append `Value` to name of convenience methods.
- keep-non-overloadable-protocol-signature: default `false`. With this flag set, we will always generate optional `RequestContext` for protocol methods. If ambiguity happens, we append `Value` to name of convenience methods.

## Scope of ambiguity we handle

Not all the pairs of protocol method and convenience method will have such problem. Below is a case when there is no ambiguity if users are calling normally by passing a `model` or a `content`. (They could not pass in `null` because it will throw error)
```C#
public virtual async Task<Response<Model>> OperationAsync(Model model, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) // Convenience method
{
    Argument.AssertNotNull(model, nameof(model));
    ...
}

public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(RequestContent content, RequestContext context = null) // Protocol method
{
    Argument.AssertNotNull(content, nameof(content));
    ...
}
```
Not all the ambiguities could be handled. For example, even we handle the example in Background section like
```C#
public virtual async Task<Response<Model>> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) // Convenience method
{
    ...
}

public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId, RequestContext context) // Protocol method
{
    ...
}
```
`OperationAsync("required", "optional", default)` and `OperationAsync("required", "optional", new())` are two examples that lead to compilation error of ambiguity.

Considering all of these, we only gaurantee that we will not generated code which leads to ambiguous call when:
1. The call doesn't have any actual parameters of `null`, `default`, `new()`. For example, we don't care whether `OperationAsync("required", "optional", default)` will lead to ambiguity. Details [here](#special-values-not-taken-into-ambiguity-consideration).
2. The call only have set required parameters. For example, we only make sure `OperationAsync("required")` is not an ambiguous call.

See below section of more specific examples and corresponding explanation.

## Examples

### Operation without input
Spec:
```
model Model {}
op operation(@path requiredId: string, @path optionalId?: string): Model;
```
What we try to generate:
```C#
public virtual async Task<Response<Model>> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) // Convenience method
{
    ...
}

public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, RequestContext context = null) // Protocol method
{
    ...
}
```
It only has one required parameter `requiredId`, so what we gaurantee will not have ambiguity is
```C#
OperationAsync("requiredId");
```
Then we find that this call has ambiguity error, so we change our signature by [one of these solutions](#solution).

### Operation with input
Spec:
```
model Model {}
op operation(@body model: Model): Model;
```
```C#
public virtual async Task<Response<Model>> OperationAsync(Model model, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) // Convenience method
{
    ...
}

public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(RequestContent content, RequestContext context = null) // Protocol method
{
    ...
}
```
No matter the input model is required or optional in spec, it is a required parameter in the signature. So we care about:
```C#
OperationAsync(new Model());
OperationAsync(new RequestContent());
```
Then we find these calls are fine, so just keep these signatures.

### Operation without both input and output
Spec:
```
op operation(@path requiredId: string, @path optionalId?: string): void;
```
What we try to generate:
```C#
public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, RequestContext context = null) // Protocol method
{
    ...
}
```
We don't generate convenience method for this case (see [this](#convenience-method-not-always-generated) to see why), so there will be no ambiguity.
### Operation with spread scenario
Spec:
```
alias OperationAlias = {
  requiredId: string;
  optionalId?: string;
};
op operation(...OperationAlias): void;
```
What we try to generate:
```C#
public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) // Convenience method
{
    ...
}
public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(RequestContent content, RequestContext context = null) // Protocol method
{
    ...
}
```
The convenience method has a required paramter `requiredId` and protocol method has a required method `content`, so what we gaurantee will not have ambiguity is
```C#
OperationAsync("requiredId");
OperationAsync(new RequestContent());
```
Then we find these calls are fine, so just keep these signatures.

## Appendix
### Convenience method not always generated
There is one [situation](#operation-without-both-input-and-output) we don't generate convenience method. Think about what would be like if we generate the convenience method.
```C#
public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) // Convenience method
{
    ...
    RequestContext context = FromCancellationToken(cancellationToken);
    OperationAsync(requiredId, optionalId, context);
    ...
}
public virtual async Task<Response> OperationAsync(string requiredId, string optionalId = null, RequestContext context = null) // Protocol method
{
    ...
}
```
The convenience method is just a wapper and doesn't have any value. So we just skip generating it.

### Special values not taken into ambiguity consideration
Think about these totally valid overloads that you've seen many times in your daily development.
```C#
class IntModel
{
    public int Value {get; set;}
}

class DoubleModel
{
    public double Value {get; set;}
}

int Add(IntModel a, IntModel b)
{
    return a.Value + b.Value;
}
double Add(DoubleModel a, DoubleModel b)
{
    return a.Value + b.Value;
}
```
When calling `Add(null, null)` or `Add(default, default)` or `Add(new(), new())`, ambiguity error still exists. Therefore we don't care about `null`, or `deafult `, or `new()`.
