# Generated Client Design

## Introduction

This document tracks design rules and decisions for .NET clients generated by the DPG generator.  It may later be extended to include other generator designs.

## Model Generation

### Model Namespace

Generated models will be added to a `.Models` namespace.

### Type mappings from Cadl to .NET

The following table shows a mapping from Cadl built-in types to the corresponding types used in .NET models.

Cadl Type | .NET Type | OpenAPI Type | GitHub Issue | Notes
------------------- | -------- | -- | -- | -------------
string | string | string | [autorest.csharp #2337](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2337) |
bytes | bytes[] | type: string, format: byte | [autorest.csharp #2337](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2337) |
int32  | int | type: integer, format: int32 | [autorest.csharp #2337](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2337) |
int64  | long | type: integer, format: int64 | [autorest.csharp #2337](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2337) |
safeint  | long | n/a | [autorest.csharp #2337](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2337) |
float32  | float | type: number, format: float | [autorest.csharp #2337](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2337) |
float64  | double | type: number, format: double | [autorest.csharp #2337](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2337) |
zonedDateTime  | DateTimeOffset | type: string, format: date-time | [autorest.csharp #2337](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2337) | Serialized differently based on body/header
duration  | TimeSpan | type: string, format: duration | [autorest.csharp #2337](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2337) |
boolean  | boolean | boolean | [autorest.csharp #2337](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2337) |
<!-- TBD | TBD | type: string, format: binary | [autorest.csharp #2500](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2500)| -->

### Model Shape

Model APIs will differ depending on whether the model is an input model, an output model, or a round-trip model (both input and output).

The following describes the model shapes for different cases of properties.

 Item |  Input | Output | Round-Trip | GitHub Issue
-- | -------| ------------ | -------- | -- |
Constructor Accessibility | public | internal | public |
Required Property | get-only | get-only | get/set | [autorest.csharp #2463](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2463)
Optional Property | get/set | get-only | get/set | [autorest.csharp #2339](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2339)
Collection Property | `IList<T>` get-only | `IReadOnlyList<T>` get-only | `IList<T>` get-only | [autorest.csharp #2471](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2471)

### Model Constructors

#### Main Constructor

- Accessibility is specified in model shape table above
- Takes required parameters and does not take optional parameters
- Validates required reference type parameters for null using `Argument.AssertNotNull`
- Takes list properties as `IEnumerable<T>` parameters
- Initializes lists from `IEnumerable` parameter using System.Linq `.ToList()`

#### Serialization Constructor

- Generated for Output and Round-trip types
- Internal accessibility
- Takes required and optional parameters
- Takes list properties as `IReadOnlyList<T>` parameters for Output models and `IList<T>` parameters for Round-trip models
- List properties are initialized by assignment

### Enums

- Enums are generated in the `.Models` namespace
- A Cadl `enum` not found in a corresponding  `@knownValues` decorator is generated as a C# `enum`
- Generated enum has corresponding internal extensions file providing conversions to/from string.
- A Cadl string model with a `@knownValues` decorator is generated as a C# "Strongly-typed string" (sometimes called "extensible enum") and the corresponding Cadl `enum` is not generated as a C# `enum`

GitHub issue: [autorest.csharp #2477](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2477)

### Nested Models

Models that are properties of other models are called nested models.  A model that appears only as a non-root of a model graph is defined as partial class according to the same rules as root models.

GitHub issue: [autorest.csharp #2489](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2489)

Requirements for model graphs with circular dependencies will be defined in a later iteration.  GitHub issue [autorest.csharp #2506](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.csharp/issues/2506)

#### Nested Model Shape

Models that appear as properties of other models have their shape determined as follows:

- Models that only appear as properties of input models are input models
- Models that only appear as properties of output models are output models
- Models that only appear as properties of round-trip models are round-trip models
- Models that appear as properties of more than one model shape are round-trip models

### Model Reference Documentation

### Miscellaneous

- Models should be generated with the `#nullable disable` because Azure SDK libraries have not yet exposed nullable reference types outside of Azure.Core.
