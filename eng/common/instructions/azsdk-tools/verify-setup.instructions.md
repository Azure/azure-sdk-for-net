description: 'Verify Setup'
---
Your goal is to identify the project repo root, and pass in the packagePath to the Verify Setup tool. For a language repo, pass in the language via the `langs` parameter (supported parameters are: python,java,dotnet,javascript,go). For a non-language repo, do not pass in any languages to just check the core requirements. Summarize the output of the tool to inform if the user's development environment is correctly set up for SDK development and release tasks.

Display results in a user-friendly and concise format, highlighting any missing dependencies or configuration issues that need to be addressed.
