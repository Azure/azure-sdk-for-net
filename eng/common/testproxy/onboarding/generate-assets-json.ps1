.SYNOPSIS
Create a default assets.json for a given ServiceDirectory or deeper.

.DESCRIPTION
Requirements:
1. git will need to be in the path.
2. This script will need to be run locally in a an azure-sdk-for-<language> repository. Further, this
needs to be run at an sdk/<ServiceDirectory> or deeper. For example sdk/core if the assets.json is
being created at the service directory level or sdk/core/<somelibrary> if the assets.json is being
created at the library level. A good rule here would be to run this in the same directory where the ci.yml
file lives. For most this is the sdk/<ServiceDirectory>, but some services emplace a ci.yml alongside each package.
In that case, the assets.json should live alongside the ci.yml in the sdk/<ServiceDirectory>/<library> directory.

Generated assets.json file contents
- AssetsRepo: "Azure/azure-sdk-assets" - This is the assets repository, aka where your recordings will live after this script runs.
- AssetsRepoPrefixPath: "<language>" - this is will be computed from repository it's being run in. 
- TagPrefix: "<language>/<ServiceDirectory>" or "<language>/<ServiceDirectory>/<library>" or deeper if things
              are nested in such a manner. All tags created for this assets.json will start with this name.
- Tag: "" - Initially empty, as nothing has yet been pushed.

If flag InitialPush is set, recordings will be automatically pushed to the assets repo and the Tag property updated.

.PARAMETER TestProxyExe
The executable used during the "InitialPush" action. Defaults to the dotnet tool test-proxy, but also supports "docker" or "podman".

If the user provides their own value that doesn't match options "test-proxy", "docker", or "podman", the script will use this input as the test-proxy exe
when invoking commands. EG "$TestProxyExe push -a sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys/assets.json."

.PARAMETER InitialPush
Pass this flag to automagically move all recordings found UNDER your assets.json to an assets repo.

Detailed process:
- Create a temp directory.
- Call "restore" against that assets directory to prepare it to receive updates.
- Move all recordings found under the assets.json within the language repo to the assets directory prepared by the restore operation in the previous step.
- Push moved recordings to the assets repo.
- Update the assets.json with the new tag.

.PARAMETER UseTestRepo
Enabling this parameter will result in an assets.json that points at repo Azure/azure-sdk-assets-integration. This is the
integration repo that the azure-sdk EngSys team uses to integration test this script and other asset-sync features.

Most library devs should ignore this setting unless directed otherwise (or if they're curious!). Permissions to the integration
repo are identical to the default assets repo.
