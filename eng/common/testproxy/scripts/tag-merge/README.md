# Merge Proxy Tags Script

This script is intended to allow simpler combination of proxy tags. This is necessary due a few facts:

- Feature teams often need to combine their efforts while adding features. This means parallel re-recording or addition of tests.
- Instead of recordings being directly alongside the feature work, able to be merged simultaneously, now recordings are a single external reference from `assets.json`.

This script merely allows the abstraction of some of this "combination" work.
