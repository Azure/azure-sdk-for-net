# This step is used to prevent duplication of artifact publishes when there is an issue that would prevent the overall success of the job.
# Ensuring that we only publish when successful (and two a differently named artifact otherwise) will allow easy retry on a build pipeline
# without running into the "cannot override artifact" failure when we finally do get a passing run.

# ArtifactName - The name of the artifact in the "successful" case.
# ArtifactPath - The path we will be publishing.
# CustomCondition - Used if there is additional logic necessary to prevent attempt of publish.
