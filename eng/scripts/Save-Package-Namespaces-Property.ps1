<#
.SYNOPSIS
Given a directory containing packageInfo json files and a repository root,
add or update the namespaces. This script MUST be run in the build job after
the build task.

.DESCRIPTION
Given a directory containing the packgeInfo json files, for each file call
to get the namespaces from the DLL and populate the packageInfo file with
the namespace information.

.PARAMETER packageInfoDirectory
The directory where the packageInfo files have been created. These files will
be updated with namespaces information.

.PARAMETER repoRoot
The root of the repository. This, along with the information in the packageInfo
files, is used to compute the the build path to the .dll so namespaces can be
parsed from it. Using Azure.Template as an example, the path to the binary would
be in $repoRoot/artifacts/bin/Azure.Template/Release/netstandard2.0/Azure.Template.dll

.PARAMETER buildConfiguration
Debug or Release. This is the same $(BuildConfiguration) variable that's used to set
in the dotnet pack command of the Build and Package task. It's necessary in order to
construct the artifacts bin directory correctly.
