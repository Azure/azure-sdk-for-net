  # What is Check Enforcer?
  
  Check Enforcer helps ensure all pull requests are covered by at least one
  check-run (typically an Azure Pipeline). When all check-runs associated
  with this pull request pass then Check Enforcer itself will pass.
  
  # Why am I getting this message?
  
  You are getting this message because Check Enforcer did not detect any
  check-runs being associated with this pull request within five minutes. This
  may indicate that your pull request is not covered by any pipelines and so
  Check Enforcer is correctly blocking the pull request being merged.
  
  # What should I do now?
  
  If the **check-enforcer** check-run is not passing and all other check-runs
  associated with this PR are passing (excluding _license-cla_) then you could
  try telling _Check Enforcer_ to evaluate your pull request again. You can
  do this by adding a comment to this pull request as follows:
  
  ```
  /check-enforcer evaluate
  ```
  
  Typically evaulation only takes a few seconds. If you know that your pull
  request is not covered by a pipeline and this is expected you can override
  Check Enforcer using the following command:
  
  ```
  /check-enforcer override
  ```
  
  Note that using the override command triggers alerts so that follow-up
  investigations can occur (PRs still need to be approved as normal).
  
  # What if I am onboarding a new service?
  
  Often, new services do not have validation pipelines associated with them.
  In order to bootstrap pipelines for a new service, please perform following steps:

  ## For data-plane/track 2 SDKs
  Issue the following command as a pull request comment:
  
  ```
  /azp run prepare-pipelines
  ```
  
  This will run a pipeline that analyzes the source tree and creates the
  pipelines necessary to build and validate your pull request. Once the pipeline
  has been created you can trigger the pipeline using the following comment:
  
  ```
  /azp run net - [service] - ci
  ```
  
  ## For track 1 management-plane SDKs
  
  Please open a separate PR and to your service SDK path in [this file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/eng/pipelines/mgmt.yml). Once that PR has been merged, you can re-run the pipeline to trigger the verification.
