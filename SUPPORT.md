## How to file issues and get help  

### Azure support tickets

Customers with an [Azure support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) can open an [Azure support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/).
**We recommend this option if your problem requires immediate attention.**

### GitHub issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/new/choose) to track bugs, questions, and feature requests.
GitHub issues are free, but **response time is not guaranteed.** See [GitHub issues support process](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/github-issue-support-process/) for more details.

To ensure the relevance and manageability of our issue queue, we have an automated process that will close issues that are over two years old and have not been updated in the last 30 days. This measure is designed to help us respond to and resolve current issues more efficiently. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a focused and up-to-date issue tracking system.
