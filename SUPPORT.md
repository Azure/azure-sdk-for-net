## How to file issues and get help  

This repository is merely a collection of tags that contain recordings and other resources. If there are issues to be filed, they likely relate to the relevant language repo rather than this assets repository.


For help and questions about using this repo, please file an issue with the label `question`. Before doing so, please read through the README.

## Microsoft Support Policy  

This is not a repo that services any Microsoft product. It merely serves as a repository of recordings for the azure-sdk-for-X language repositories.
