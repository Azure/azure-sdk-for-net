Issues fixed in 2.0.1 : 
	
	1. All: CloudStorageAccount.*Parse methods throw an exception for “UseDevelopmentStorage=true” string
	2. All: StorageErrorCodeStrings class is missing
	3. Blobs: ICloudBlob interface does not have GetSharedAccessSignature method

Issues fixed in 2.0.2 :

	1. All: CompletedSynchronously property returns inconsistent values on IAsyncResult objects returned by asynchronous methods and thus TaskFactory.FromAsync does not work properly
	2. Tables: Public DynamicTableEntity constructors use DateTime even though the Timestamp property is of type DateTimeOffset
	3. Tables: BeginSaveChangesWithRetries overload ignores the options argument

Issues fixed in 2.0.3 :

	1. All (RT): General metadata correctness test fails when using the RT library to develop windows store apps
	2. Queues: CloudQueueMessage.MaxNumberOfMessagesToPeek, CloudQueueMessage.MaxMessageSize and CloudQueueMessage.MaximumTimeToLive have disappeared from CloudQueueMessage
	3. Queues: CloudQueue.BeginCreateIfNotExists and CloudQueue.BeginDeleteIfExists methods expect valid options argument
	4. Tables: When one or more of the batches fails, but then succeeds on a retry, the "extra" TableResults of the failed transactions are also returned
	5. Tables: TableQuery.GenerateFilterConditionForLong does not append 'L' at the end of the value and thus values larger than Int32.MaxValue cannot be used when filtering
	6. Tables: TableEntity does not support serializing nullable values
	7. Tables: CloudTable.EndListTablesSegmented method does not work correctly

Issues fixed in 2.0.4 :

	1. All: Flush HttpWebRequest's request stream before calling BeginGetResponse
	2. All: Support Null Retry Policies
	3. Blob: Continue ListContainers parsing if a container property is unknown 
	4. Queue (RT): DeleteMessageAsync(string messageId, string popReceipt) ignores the messageId and popReceipt
	5. Tables: Add a TableConstant to define minimum DateTime supported
	6. Tables: Correct count behavior with synchronous non segmented execution
	7. Tables: Allow String.Empty in TableQuery Filters

Issues fixed in 2.0.4.1 :

	1. All: Updated Odata dependency to latest and also changed nuspec to allow any version >= 5.2.0

Issues fixed in 2.0.5 :

	1. All: StorageException is now serializable. Also, other useful objects for debugging (StorageExtendedErrorInformation and RequestResult) are also serializable
	2. All: SharedAccessSignature helper now uses culture invariant characteristics to calculate SAS
	3. All: CloudStorageAccount can now parse connection strings with extra blank values
	4. All: OperationContext StartTime and EndTime are now populated during execution
	5. All: StorageCredentials.UpdateKey does not work on SAS/Anonymous credentials anymore
	6. All: Metadata headers are now sorted using en-US culture to prevent 403 errors in some cultures
	7. All: Fixed issue where in some cases a sync method call could result in a 0 ms timeout being set on HttpWebRequest.
	8. Blob: Snapshot time embedded in blob Uri is parsed in the constructor
	9. Blob: GetBlobReferenceFromServer works with blob Uri that contain a SAS token
	10. Blob: BlobWriteStream now honors AccessCondition
	11. Blob: BlobWriteStream prevents using StoreBlobContentMD5 on existing page blobs
	12. Blob: ICloudBlob now has OpenRead method
	13. Blob: Cloud*Blob.OpenRead now can be used with snapshots
	14. Blob: AbortCopy does not throw an exception anymore when a copy is successfully aborted
	15. Queue: Ability to recreate CloudQueueMessage with Message Id and Pop Receipt
	16. Table: Exceptions during TableBatchOperation now parse the entity index from the server response
	17. Table: Floating-point number filter is now generated using invariant culture

Issues fixed in 2.0.5.1 :

	1. All: Drain HttpWebResponse's response stream before closing it
