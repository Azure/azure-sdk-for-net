Therefore, unless you select&nbsp;Extended Automatic Renewal, Azure will enroll you in&nbsp;Automatic Renewal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Domain names will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, any domain name that is up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with Azure, at Azure's then current rates. Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, Azure will automatically renew it for one (1) year. If you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, Azure will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.</li>\\r\\n<li><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">Extended Automatic Renewal</span>.&nbsp; If you enroll in the Extended Automatic Renewal plan, Azure will automatically renew any domain name that is up for renewal for an additional one-year period on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration, so the initial registration period will always remain intact.&nbsp; Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, Azure will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your two (2) year registration period will always remain intact. If you have chosen to register your domain name for five (5) years, Azure will automatically renew it for one (1) additional year on each and every anniversary of your domain name registration so your five (5) year registration period will always remain intact, and so on.&nbsp; Azure will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with Azure, at Azure's then current one-year domain name registration rate.</li>\\r\\n<li><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">Manual Renewal</span>.&nbsp; If you have elected to turn off automatic renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel&nbsp;the domain name registration) efefctive at expiration of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its&nbsp;expiration date&nbsp;by&nbsp;logging into&nbsp;your <a href=\\\"https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/shopper_lookup.asp?prog_id=510456\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Account Manager</a>&nbsp;and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed). If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">All renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.&nbsp; Domain name renewals will be non-refundable. <span style=\\\"color: #5b9bd5; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-themecolor: accent1;\\\"><span style=\\\"color: #000000;\\\">In the event that we are unable to automatically renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than your original registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.</span> </span>If for any reason Azure is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name registration will expire. It is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method information current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .br, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk,&nbsp;and .vg), renewal billing will occur on the first day of the month prior to the month of expiration.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk,&nbsp;and .vg),&nbsp;renewal will occur, or must occur manually if the product was previously cancelled, no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status. For some ccTLDs (.es) renewal&nbsp;must be processed&nbsp;no later than seven days before the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.&nbsp; When the domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by calling Azure and requesting that the domain name be renewed. You cannot renew the domain name through your <a href=\\\"https://www.securepaynet.net/gdshop/shopper_lookup.asp?prog_id=510456\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Account Manager</a>. If you fail to manually implement the renewal of any cancelled product before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">You agree that Azure will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail to renew in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement. In any case, if you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply. If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you cancel in advance.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">If you fail to renew your domain name in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that Azure may, in its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf. If Azure decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you may reimburse Azure for the renewal and keep your domain name. The Renewal Grace Period is currently twelve (12) days but subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk,&nbsp;and .vg) there is no Renewal Grace Period after the expiration date of the domain name. If you do not reimburse Azure for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you will have a 30-day redemption period during which you may pay Azure a Redemption fee and redeem your domain name. The Redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement. If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the 30-day redemption period Azure may, in its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.&nbsp; During the redemption period your domain name may be parked.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: justify;\\\">If your domain name is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30-day Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay Azure a redemption fee and redeem your domain name. The redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.

Correspondence Forwarding </strong></p>\\r\\n<p>Inasmuch as DBP's name, postal address and phone number will be listed in the Whois directory, You agree DBP will review and forward communications addressed to Your domain name that are received via email, certified or traceable courier mail (such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or first class U.S. postal mail. You specifically acknowledge DBP will not forward to You first class postal mail (other than legal notices), \\\"junk\\\" mail or other unsolicited communications (whether delivered through email, fax, postal mail or telephone), and You further authorize DBP to either discard all such communications or return all such communications to sender unopened. You agree to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive communications directed to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by DBP.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>b. Email Forwarding </strong></p>\\r\\n<p>The Whois directory requires an email address for every purchased domain name registration. When You purchase a private domain registration, DBP creates a private email address for that domain name, \\\"@domainsbyproxy.com\\\". Thereafter, when messages are sent to that private email address, DBP handles them according to the email preference You selected for that particular domain name. You have three (3) email preferences from which to choose. You can elect to:</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Have all of the messages forwarded;</li>\\r\\n<li>Have all of the messages filtered for Spam and then forwarded; or</li>\\r\\n<li>Have none of the messages forwarded.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>As with all communications, You agree to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive email directed to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by DBP.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>c. Notifications Regarding Correspondence and Your Obligation to Respond </strong></p>\\r\\n<p>When DBP receives certified or traceable courier mail or legal notices addressed to Your domain name, in most cases, DBP will attempt to forward the mail to you via email. If&nbsp;You do not respond to the DBP email and/or the correspondence DBP has received regarding&nbsp;Your domain name registration concerns a&nbsp;dispute of any kind or otherwise requires immediate disposition, DBP may immediately reveal Your identity and/or cancel the DBP private registration service regarding either the domain name registration(s) in question.&nbsp;This means the Whois directory will revert to displaying Your name, postal address, email address and phone number that you provided to DBP.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>d.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Additional Administrative Fees </strong></p>\\r\\n<p>DBP reserves the right to charge You&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;\\\"administrative fees\\\" or \\\"processing fees\\\" for (i) &nbsp;tasks DBP may perform outside the normal scope of its&nbsp;Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs DBP may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) Your non-compliance with the Agreement (as determined by DBP in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios&nbsp;include, but are not limited to, (i) customer service issues that&nbsp;require additional personal time and attention; (ii)&nbsp;disputes that require accounting or&nbsp;legal services, whether performed by DBP staff or by outside firms retained by DBP; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by DBP as the result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by You, Your bank or Payment Method processor.&nbsp; These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method You have on file with&nbsp;Your Registrar.</p>\\r\\n<p>You agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any proceeding that takes place relating to or arising out of this Agreement.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"heading1\\\">6. limitations of liability</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL DBP BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION, DBP'S SERVICES, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE DBP WEBSITE OR THE MATERIALS AND CONTENT OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY OTHER WEBSITES LINKED TO THE DBP WEBSITE OR YOUR PROVISION OF ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO DBP OR ANY THIRD PARTY.
