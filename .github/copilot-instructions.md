## Folder Structure

- `/eng/packages/http-client-csharp`: Contains the source code of the generator for Azure Data Plane SDKs (aka Azure Generator).
- `/eng/packages/http-client-csharp-mgmt`: Contains the source code of the generator for Azure Management Plane SDKs (aka Azure Management Generator).
- `/sdk`: Contains the individual SDKs for Azure services.

### Azure Generator

- Always run `npm install` in the `/eng/packages/http-client-csharp` directory before running the generator.
- Always run `/eng/packages/http-client-csharp/eng/scripts/Generate.ps1` to regenerate the test projects to validate the result of generator code changes.

### Azure Management Generator

- Always run `npm install` in the `/eng/packages/http-client-csharp-mgmt` directory before running the generator.
- Always run `/eng/packages/http-client-csharp-mgmt/eng/scripts/Generate.ps1` to regenerate the test projects to validate the result of generator code changes.

## SDK release

There are two tools to help with SDK releases:
- Check SDK release readiness
- Release SDK

### Check SDK Release Readiness
Run `CheckPackageReleaseReadiness` to verify if the package is ready for release. This tool checks:
- API review status
- Change log status
- Package name approval(If package is new and releasing a preview version)
- Release date is set in release tracker

### Release SDK
Run `ReleasePackage` to release the package. This tool requires package name and language as inputs. It will:
- Check if the package is ready for release
- Identify the release pipeline
- Trigger the release pipeline.
User needs to approve the release stage in the pipeline after it is triggered.
