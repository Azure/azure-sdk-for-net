## Pull Request etiquette and best practices

### Reviewers

- If you disagree with the overall approach of the PR, comment on the general PR rather than individual lines of code.
- Leaving [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request) is welcomed, but please never commit them for a PR you did not create.
- When you are seeking to understand something rather than request corrections, it is suggested to use language such as "I'm curious ..." as a prefix to comments.
- Avoid marking a PR as Request Changes unless you have serious concerns that should block the PR from merging.

### PR Authors

- If significant changes are added to a PR after it has been marked approved, confirm with reviewers that they still approve before merging.
- If a reviewer marks your PR as approved along with specific comments, it is expected that those comments will be addressed or resolved prior to merging.
  - One exception is when a comment clearly states that the feedback is optional or just a nit
  - When in doubt, reach out to the commentor to confirm that they have no concerns with you merging without addressing a comment.
