### Changes in 5.0.0
#### Features
- Added `CommitChanges` method on `CloudJob`, `CloudJobSchedule` and `CloudPool`, which use the HTTP PATCH verb to perform partial updates, which can be safer if multiple clients are making concurrent changes).
- Added support for joining a `CloudPool` to a virtual network on using the `NetworkConfiguration` property.
- Added support for automatically terminating jobs when all tasks complete or when a task fails, via the `CloudJob.OnAllTasksComplete` and `CloudJob.OnAllTasksFailure` properties, and the `CloudTask.ExitConditions` property.
- Added support for application package references on `CloudTask` and `JobManagerTask`.


#### Documentation
- Improved documentation across various classes in the `Microsoft.Azure.Batch` namespace as well as the `Microsoft.Azure.Batch.Protocol` namespaces.
- Improved documentation for `AddTask` overload which takes a collection of `CloudTask` objects to include details about possible exceptions.
- Improved documentation for the `WhenAll`/`WaitAll` methods of `TaskStateMonitor`.

#### Other
- Updated constructors for the following types to more clearly convey their required properties:
  - `JobManagerTask`
  - `JobPreparationTask`
  - `JobReleaseTask`
  - `JobSpecification`
  - `StartTask`
- `TaskStateMonitor` changes:
  - Removed previously Obsolete method `WaitAllAsync`.
  - Removed `WaitAll` which returns `Task<bool>`.
  - Renamed `WhenAllAsync` to `WhenAll`.
  - `WhenAll` overloads now have a consistent return type.
  - Refactored existing methods to provide an overload which takes a `CancellationToken`, and an overload which takes a timeout.  Removed the overload which takes both.

#### REST API version
This version of the Batch .NET client library targets version 2016-07-01.3.1 of the Azure Batch REST API.

### Changes in 4.0.1
#### Bug fixes
-  Fixed a bug where specifying a `DetailLevel` on a list operation would fail if the Batch service returned a list spanning multiple pages.
-  Fixed a bug where `TaskDependencies` and `ApplicationPackageSummary` could throw a `NullReferenceException` if the Batch service returned a collection that was null.
-  Fixed a bug where `PoolOperations.ListNodeAgentSkus` and `PoolOperations.ListPoolUsageMetrics` were missing support for `DetailLevel`.
-  Updated `FileMode` comment to clarify that the default is `0770` instead of `0600`. 

#### REST API version
This version of the Batch .NET client library targets version 2016-02-01.3.0 of the Azure Batch REST API.

### Changes in 4.0.0
#### Package dependencies
-  Removed Hyak.Common dependency.
-  Removed Microsoft.Azure.Common dependency.
-  Added Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime.Azure dependency.
-  Updated Azure.Storage 4.x to 6.x.

#### Features
-  Azure Batch now supports Linux compute nodes (you can see which Linux distributions and versions are supported by using the new `ListNodeAgentSkus` API).
-  New API `ListNodeAgentSkus`.
-  New API `GetRemoteLoginSettings`.
-  `ResourceFile` now has a property `FileMode` which is used for Linux VM file download.
-  All node file deletion methods now take an optional recursive option (which can be used on directories).
-  Properties can now be read on objects after they have been committed.  An exception will be thrown if you attempt to write them though.
-  `Refresh()` can now be called on objects after they have been added via `Commit()`.
-  Added a new namespace `Microsoft.Azure.Batch.Protocol.BatchRequests` which contains types defined for each type of `BatchRequest`.  This is useful for writing interceptors.
-  Changed various properties which had a type of `IEnumerable` to `IReadOnlyList` because they are explicitly read-only.
-  Changed `CloudJob.CommonEnvironmentSettings` type from `IEnumerable` to `IList`.

#### Bug fixes
-  Fixed bug where `Enable` and `Disable` scheduling APIs weren't correctly inheriting the behaviors of their parent objects.
-  Fixed bug in signing which breaks some requests issued with custom conditional headers such as If-Match.
-  Fixed a few possible memory leaks.

#### Breaking and default behavior changes
-  Changed the default exception thrown from all synchronous methods.  Previously, all synchronous methods threw an `AggregateException`, which usually contained a single inner exception.  Now that inner exception will be thrown directly and it will not be wrapped in an outer `AggregateException`.
-  Changed `AddTask(IEnumerable<CloudTask>)` to always wrap exceptions from its many parallel REST requests in a `ParallelOperationsException`.  Note that in some cases (such as when performing validation before issuing requests) this method can throw exceptions other than a `ParallelOperationsException`.
-  The `CloudPool` class has changed to support the creation and management of Linux pools based on the virtual machine compute infrastructure as well as Windows pools based on the Azure cloud services platform.
    -  To configure pools based on Azure cloud services, use the `CloudPool.CloudServiceConfiguration` property.
    -  To configure pools based on the virtual machines infrastructure (specifically Linux pools), use the `CloudPool.VirtualMachineConfiguration` property.
    -  The `OSFamily` and `TargetOSVersion` properties are no longer directly on the CloudPool type.  These properties apply only to cloud service pools and are now on the `CloudServiceConfiguration` type.
-  Enumerations
    -  Renamed `CertificateVisibility.RemoteDesktop` to `CertificateVisibility.RemoteUser`.
    -  Renamed `CertificateVisibility.Invalid` to `CertificateVisibility.None`.
    -  Removed `Unmapped` state for enumerations which the Batch service guarantees backwards compatibility with.
    -  Removed `Invalid` state from all enums, as this is now represented by the nullability of the enum.
-  Removed `ComputeNodeUser` constructor. Use the `CreateComputeNodeUser` method of the `ComputeNode` or `PoolOperations` classes instead.
-  Renamed `AutoScaleEvaluation` class to `AutoScaleRun`, and removed property `DataServiceId`.
-  Using a `DetailLevel` that is not supported by an operation now throws an exception (e.g. trying to use `FilterClause` on an API that doesn't support it, or trying to use `SelectClause` on an API that doesn't support it).
-  Renamed `AzureError` type to `BatchError`. This should now be accessed on the `BatchException` via `BatchException.RequestInformation.BatchError`.
-  Changed `AddTaskResult`:
    -  `StatusCode` is now Status and is an enum instead of an int.
    -  `ContentId` removed.
    -  `DataServiceId` removed.
-  `BatchClient.Open` and `BatchClient.OpenAsync` now take a `BatchServiceClient` object, not a `BatchRestClient` object.
-  Made `AffinityInformation` read-only after construction.
-  Changed `TaskSchedulingPolicy.ComputeNodeFillType` to be non-nullable.
-  Removed `ReadAsStringAsync` optional Stream parameter.
-  Refactored the protocol namespace. It is now generated via the AutoRest tool (https://github.com/Azure/autorest).
    -  Removed the `BatchRequest` constructor which took a `BatchRestClient` (it had been marked obsolete since Azure.Batch 3.0.0).
    -  Significantly refactored `BatchRequest`.
    -  Changed request interceptor types to reflect changes to `BatchRequest`.
    -  Changed most types in this namespace to comply with the new underlying protocol layer generated by AutoRest.
-  Removed `ResourceStatistics.DiskWriteIOps` setter.
-  Removed `TaskInformation.JobScheduleId` property.
