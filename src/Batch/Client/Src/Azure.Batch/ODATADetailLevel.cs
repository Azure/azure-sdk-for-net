    /// Controls the amount of detail requested from the Azure Batch service when listing or
    /// retrieving resources, using OData query clauses.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>Azure Batch supports OData queries, which allow the client to gain finer control over query
    /// performance by controlling which resources are returned in List operations (<see cref="FilterClause"/>),
    /// and which properties of each resource are returned in List, Get or Refresh operations
    /// (<see cref="SelectClause"/> and <see cref="ExpandClause"/>).</para>
    /// <para>By default, if you do not pass a <see cref="DetailLevel"/> to a List, Get or Refresh operation,
    /// the Batch client specifies no filter (all records are returned), no select clause (all simple properties are
    /// returned) and no expand clause (associated entities are not returned).  Consequently, by default, associated entity
    /// properties are null, rather than being populated like other properties.  Refer to individual class
    /// documentation to find out which properties are considered associated entities and need to be expanded
    /// to be populated.</para>
    /// <para>Because the OData queries are passed directly to the REST API, clause strings must use the JSON attribute
    /// names from the REST API, which are not always the same as .NET property names.  For example, the
    /// .NET <see cref="CloudPool.VirtualMachineSize">CloudPool.VirtualMachineSize</see> property corresponds to
    /// the vmSize attribute in the REST API; therefore, to filter a pool list operations by VM size, you would
    /// need to write vmSize rather than VirtualMachineSize in your filter string.  Refer to the REST API
    /// documentation to find out the JSON attribute name corresponding to a .NET property.</para>
    /// <para>For additional information about using OData to efficiently query the Azure Batch service, see
