How to run the Batch Client integration tests:

1. Set the environment variables required by the tests.  These variables are specified in ClientIntegrationTestCommon.cs, 
   but at the time this howto was written they include:
        1. MABOM_BatchAccountKey
        2. MABOM_BatchAccountName
        3. MABOM_BatchAccountEndpoint
        4. MABOM_StorageKey
        5. MABOM_StorageAccount
        6. MABOM_BlobEndpoint
        7. MABOM_BatchCertThumbprint (The thumbprint of the certificate to use for authenticating to the Batch Resource Provider)
        8. MABOM_BatchAccountSubscriptionId
        9. MABOM_BatchManagementEndpoint
        10.MABOM_BatchAccountResourceGroupName

You can use the SetupBatchIntegrationTestEnvironment script in the Batch root directory to set these up automatically.
