      <![CDATA[
This release contains some important changes to allow for more fine-grained role-based access to obtain sensitive credentials. As part of these changes, ACTION MAY BE REQUIRED if you are using one of the affected methods: 
1) ClusterOperationsExtensions.GetClusterConfigurations will NO LONGER RETURN SENSITIVE PARAMETERS like storage keys (core-site) or HTTP credentials (gateway). 
  - To retrieve all configurations, including sensitive parameters, use ClusterOperationsExtensions.ListConfigurations going forward.  Not that users with the 'Reader' role will not be able to use this method to allow for fine-grained control over which users can access cluster secrets. 
  - To retrieve just HTTP gateway credentials, use ClusterOperationsExtensions.GetGatewaySettings. 
2) ClusterOperationsExtensions.GetConnectivitySettings is now deprecated and has been replaced by ClusterOperationsExtensions.GetGatewaySettings. 
3) ClusterOperationsExtensions.ConfigureHttpSettings is now deprecated and has been replaced by ClusterOperationsExtensions.UpdateGatewaySettings. 
4) ConfigurationsOperationsExtensions.EnableHttp and DisableHttp are now deprecated. Http is now always enabled, so these methods are no longer needed.
