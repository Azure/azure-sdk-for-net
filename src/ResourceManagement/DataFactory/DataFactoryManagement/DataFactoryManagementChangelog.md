_Release date: 2015.10.13_

## Bug Fixes
* Fix Dataset class names which had "Table" removed from them.

    * OracleDatabaseDataset → OracleTableDataset
    * RelationalDataset → RelationalTableDataset
    * SqlServerDataset → SqlServerTableDataset
    * For types such as AzureSqlTable, "AzureSqlTableDataset" is the correct naming, not "AzureSqlDataset". These were the names prior to 4.0.0 and this restores those names. 

## Version 4.0.0
_Release date: 2015.10.02_

### Breaking Changes
    
* Send requests with API version 2015-10-01.
    * List API calls return paged results. If the response contains a non-empty NextLink property, the client application needs to continue fetching the next page until all pages are returned.
    * List pipeline API call returns only the summary of a pipeline instead of full details. For instance, activities in a pipeline summary only contain name and type.
* ITableOperations → IDatasetOperations 
* Models.Table → Models.Dataset
* Models.TableProperties → Models.DatasetProperties
* Models.TableTypeProprerties → Models.DatasetTypeProperties
* Models.TableCreateOrUpdateParameters → Models.DatasetCreateOrUpdateParameters
* Models.TableCreateOrUpdateResponse → Models.DatasetCreateOrUpdateResponse
* Models.TableGetResponse → Models.DatasetGetResponse
* Models.TableListResponse → Models.DatasetListResponse
* Models.CreateOrUpdateWithRawJsonContentParameters.cs → Models.DatasetCreateOrUpdateWithRawJsonContentParameters.cs

    * Does not accept copy-related properties removed in version 2.0.0 for create requests. 
* Remove Database and Schema properties from TeradataLinkedService. 

### Feature Additions
* New Activity type: AzureMLBatchExecutionActivity.

    * The Linked Services collection contains all the Linked Services referenced by the activity and the Tables.
* Remove Published property from TableProperties.
