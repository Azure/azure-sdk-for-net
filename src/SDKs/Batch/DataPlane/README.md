# License notes
The Azure Batch C# client is now under the MIT license. Prior to March 10 2017 it was under the Apache 2.0 license.

# Azure Batch client developer guide
Batch.sln is your one stop shop for all things related to the Azure Batch C# client library. This solution file contains all of the projects affiliated with the Azure Batch client (including testing and tooling).

## Changing the Azure Batch client
Depending on the type of change you want to make, the work required varies. If you follow this process you shouldn't miss anything:

1. Update the Azure Batch Swagger specification, which resides in the [Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) GitHub repository.
  * Add new entity types into the Swagger specification.
  * Add new APIs as path-verb pairs in the Swagger specification.
  * Add/remove properties on existing entity types in the Swagger specification.
2. Regenerate the `src\GeneratedProtocol` folder using the steps [below](#the-srcgeneratedprotocol-folder).
3. Update the convenience layer specification file: `Tools\ObjectModelCodeGeneration\ObjectModelCodeGenerator\BatchProperties.json`.
  * Add new entities that match the Swagger defined entities.
  * Add/remove properties on existing entities as done in the Swagger specification.
4. Regenerate the `src\Generated` folder from the convenience layer specification file using the steps [below](#the-srcgenerated-folder).
5. Add any custom code on the `Generated` objects into `partial` classes located in the `src` directory.
  * You might want to do this to add an `[Obsolete]` attribute or to add some helper factory methods.
6. If any APIs have changed, or if new APIs have been added, you must update the following places:
  * The `src\IProtocolLayer.cs` interface.
  * The `src\ProtocolLayer.cs` class.  
  * The corresponding operations class, for example `PoolOperations.cs`.
  * The corresponding entity which the operation is performed on, for example `CloudPool.cs`. 
7. Add tests for your new models and APIs into the correct test projects.
  * `Azure.Batch.Unit.Tests` for unit tests. These tests do not have any external dependencies (they run entirely in-memory) and are used in the continuous integration job to validate checkins. 
  * `BatchClientIntegrationTests` for integration tests. These tests run against a live Azure Batch endpoint and do not run during CI.
  * **Note:** You should prefer to add unit tests over integration tests where possible -- integration tests should be reserved for ensuring that the Batch Service accepts the Swagger requests. Testing service behavior should occur in a service test, not the client.

### The `src\GeneratedProtocol` folder
The GeneratedProtocol folder holds the code generated by the AutoRest tool from a Swagger specification. In order to regenerate this code, all you need to do is run: `RegenerateBatch.cmd <Path to Swagger file>`.

You can optionally edit the `RegenerateBatch.cmd` script to point to a newer version of AutoRest if you would like to take advantage of new AutoRest features.

### The `src\Generated` folder
This folder contains the convenience layer models for Azure Batch. It is generated from a custom tool. The custom tool reads a specification file located here: `Tools\ObjectModelCodeGeneration\ObjectModelCodeGenerator\BatchProperties.json`. The convenience layer models require more metadata than the Swagger specification provides, so this file is an extra mapping layer on top of Swagger which provides more detail. **Note:** The `BatchProperties.json` specification file just contains the entities; it doesn't have anything related to the actual APIs. 

1. New entities defined in the Swagger specification have to be added here as well. See an existing entity for an example.
2. If the type or name of a property has changed in the underlying Swagger specification, it should be updated here as well.

There are a number of special flags which have meaning in the `BatchProperties.json` file. The easiest way to see a list of what flags are supported and at what level is to look at the backing code generation code:

1. For properties: `Tools\ObjectModelCodeGeneration\CodeGenerationLibrary\PropertyData.cs` 
2. For types: `Tools\ObjectModelCodeGeneration\CodeGenerationLibrary\ObjectModelTypeData.cs`
 
Once `BatchProperties.json` is updated with your changes, mark the `ObjectModelCodeGenerator` as your startup project in Visual Studio and run it -- it will regenerate the contents of the `src\Generated` folder.
