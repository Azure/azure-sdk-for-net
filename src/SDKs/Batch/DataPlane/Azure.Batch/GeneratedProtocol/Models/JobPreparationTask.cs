    /// <remarks>
    /// You can use Job Preparation to prepare a compute node to run tasks for
    /// the job. Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include:
    /// Downloading common resource files used by all the tasks in the job. The
    /// Job Preparation task can download these common resource files to the
    /// shared location on the compute node. (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\shared),
    /// or starting a local service on the compute node so that all tasks of
    /// that job can communicate with it. If the Job Preparation task fails
    /// (that is, exhausts its retry count before exiting with exit code 0),
    /// Batch will not run tasks of this job on the compute node. The node
    /// remains ineligible to run tasks of this job until it is reimaged. The
    /// node remains active and can be used for other jobs. The Job Preparation
    /// task can run multiple times on the same compute node. Therefore, you
    /// should write the Job Preparation task to handle re-execution. If the
    /// compute node is rebooted, the Job Preparation task is run again on the
    /// node before scheduling any other task of the job, if
    /// rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation task
    /// did not previously complete. If the compute node is reimaged, the Job
    /// Preparation task is run again before scheduling any task of the job.
    /// Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a
    /// compute node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not
    /// limited to) when an unhealthy compute node is rebooted or a compute
    /// node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery
    /// operations are independent of and are not counted against the
    /// maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal
    /// retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all tasks
    /// should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being
    /// interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate
    /// data. The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of
    /// checkpointing.
