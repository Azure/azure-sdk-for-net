    /// The Job Release task runs when the job ends, because of one of the
    /// following: The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API
    /// while the job is still active, the job's maximum wall clock time
    /// constraint is reached, and the job is still active, or the job's Job
    /// Manager task completed, and the job is configured to terminate when the
    /// Job Manager completes. The Job Release task runs on each compute node
    /// where tasks of the job have run and the Job Preparation task ran and
    /// completed. If you reimage a compute node after it has run the Job
    /// Preparation task, and the job ends without any further tasks of the job
    /// running on that compute node (and hence the Job Preparation task does
    /// not re-run), then the Job Release task does not run on that node. If a
    /// compute node reboots while the Job Release task is still running, the
    /// Job Release task runs again when the compute node starts up. The job is
    /// not marked as complete until all Job Release tasks have completed. The
