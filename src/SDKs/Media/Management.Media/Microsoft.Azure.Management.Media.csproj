            <![CDATA[
        Updates from the GA release of the V3 API include:
        
        * The PresentationTimeRange properties are no longer 'required' for AssetFilters and AccountFilters. 
        * The $top and $skip query options for Jobs and Transforms have been removed and $orderby was added. As part of adding the new ordering functionality, it was discovered that the $top and $skip options had accidentally been exposed previously even though they are not implemented.
        * Enumeration extensibility was re-enabled. This feature was enabled in the preview versions of the SDK and got accidentally disabled in the GA version.
        * Two predefined streaming policies have been renamed. SecureStreaming is now MultiDrmCencStreaming. SecureStreamingWithFairPlay is now Predefined_MultiDrmStreaming.
