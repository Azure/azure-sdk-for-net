            A Windows Azure drive acts as a local drive mounted on the file system and is accessible 
            to code running in a role. The data written to a Windows Azure drive is stored in a page blob
            defined within the Windows Azure Blob service, and cached on the local file system. Because 
            data written to the drive is stored in a page blob, the data is maintained across the 
            lifecycle of the role instance.

            By default, Azure Drives will use the Account Shared Key to authenticate with the 
            Azure Blob Service. It requires the secret key to be cached outside the calling
            process. This may be a security concern for some applications and the risk can be 
            mitigated by setting this flag. However if this flag is set and the calling 
            process is terminated, then the drive will auto-unmount when the Shared Access
            Credentials expire.
